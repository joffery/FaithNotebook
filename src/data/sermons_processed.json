    "transcript": "John chapter 14. It says in verse one, \"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. You know, trouble, confusion, fear, embarrassment, when your heart is troubled, moved out of place where it needs to be, it could take you else there. Storms are Have you if you've ever seen, we're in Tampa. the the hurricanes could be massive and they could be bigger still. WHO KNOWS WHAT H WHAT WE HAVE IN STORE WITH THE THE THE the catastrophes and phenomenons of nature and they could take anything else. Even the the largest ships, the biggest buildings can be taken out by storms. But here I believe what Jesus is saying is that when you believe in him, when you have faith in him, you can weather any storm. No matter how big, no matter how tough, even if objectively it should be taking you out, you could weather any storm. You could fight any battle. You can brace any hardship as long as you have faith in Christ. And of course, that is the main point OF THIS BOOK, FAITH. SO TODAY, WE'LL BE TALKING about faith, but we'll be talking about what could take out your faith, and that is trouble in your hearts. Why? Because trouble leads to hopelessness if you allow it to stay too long. You know, last night I had a hard time falling asleep. And I'll tell another brother that mentally just a lot was going on in my mind. Thinking about the people that I admire, the men that I want to be like who are great leaders, friends of mine, people who I want to be friends with, great leaders when it comes to ministry, great leaders when it comes to their marriages. And it's like, God, why can't I be like that? It feels so far away. And yet other disciples have it. SO IT'S ATTAINABLE. BUT WHY AM I not like that right now and my heart was feeling really troubled and and then uh my wife comes in and I'm kind of just sitting there and I'm listening to uh to music and you know when I my heart gets trouble I like listening to different kinds of music. I started off listening just to instrumental like classical music and I feel like the the no words allows me to have the thoughts myself. &gt;&gt; And so you just let the music just move your heart. You're just like, what's going on up there? And then um this might sound weird, but one of my favorite uh movies or I guess you could say plays is The Phantom of the Opera. And &gt;&gt; the music is so powerful, so good. Uh, if you haven't watched it, the movie's good, but they have the uh the film play on Amazon, which um but I'm listening to these different songs and after doing that for like an hour or two, I switched to Kingdom songs. And so now I'm listening to Kingdom songs. Some of you guys may know uh some of the older songs I love listening to. If you guys know my God Almighty Reigns, that song is so powerful. Um the song called uh I Shall Wear the Golden Crown, a beautiful song. Of course, other songs that we sing commonly, things like I love to praise him. &gt;&gt; Love that song. And I'm either, you know, I'm just listening to it. I'm trying to sing, but I feel like I just want to just listen to it. Just just hear the songs right now. Uh there's another song called Jesus Will Wipe Away All Tears. Beautiful song. And then I I come across a song uh Jesus will fix it. And the the lyrics, it goes, \"Trouble comes my way, you got to pray sometimes. Trouble comes my way, you got to pray sometimes.\" And there's a line in there that we don't typically sing, but some people sing it. It and this is where I felt is I wait I laid awake last night, but that's all right. I know that Jesus, he's going to fix it after a while. And to me, that describes when your heart is troubled. You just lay awake at night and you just I just just lost just confused. How do you press forward? And sometimes you don't even need the answer right away. I know that Jesus is going to fix it even if it's after a while. So my title for us today is when trouble comes my way. Point number one is I have to pray sometimes. &gt;&gt; And that will be our ONLY POINT. WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT PRAYER &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; and how much we need to pray. And I'm here to tell YOU THAT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FAITH IN JESUS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, he will fix it. Even if it's after a while, &gt;&gt; you just got to pray sometimes. In verse of chapter 14, it says, \"Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these because I am going to the Father, and I will do whatever you ask in my name.\" So that the father may be glorified in the son. You may ask me for anything in my name and I will do it. You know, you cannot glorify God in your work if you're not glorifying him in your prayer. And I I love this passage. Jesus is saying, \"Ask me anything and I will do it for you.\" And you're like, \"Well, anything? Like really anything? Is that like is there no bounds to what I can ask for? another movie. Sorry, the truck. That's funny. And it got me thinking of um I'm not a huge fan of Disney movies, but there's one I really like. It's The Hunchback of Notre Dame. I think it's the best Disney film if you ask me by far. And there's this scene in the movie where uh the two leads of course you have Quasimoto and you have Esmeralda and she is torn because of how she sees spiritual people acting and specifically the leader or other people a part of the church and now she's in the church and it's a song that she's singing and you hear the comparison of prayers and some were saying I asked for fame I asked for honor. I ask for glory in my own name. And then she's saying, I ask for nothing. And it's interesting what it means to pray for anything because if you're a disciple, anything is a lot different for you than other people. You don't pray for the same things. In fact, the world of things that you even want to pray for is fundamentally different. Let's go to James chapter 4. But prayer is important because prayer helps you acknowledge that all power lies with God and that you can do all these different things, do your best to obey him, and that's good. But do you believe only God can make it happen? In James chapter 4 in verse one, it says, \"What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet, but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. When you ask, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. You adulterous people. Don't you know that friendship with the world means enity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. Or do you think scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us? You know this passage, it literally says that you desire but you do not have and so that you kill. And we know that kill is not even just literally killing. John as we're go we're reading through right now the gospel but of course later in first John he equates killing murder to not loving your brothers. But we we'll get to that later. But here also says that you know you desire you not have. You covet but you cannot get because you ask with the wrong motives. Your motives are all off. And you know we talk about yeah only God can judge me. How how can you tell me my prayers are wrong? Well that's possible. You ever thought about that but you could be praying wrong. That matters a lot. It's like well you can't you you can't tell me my prayers are wrong. It's like well let's pray together and find out. It's possible. And it says in verse four, you adulterous people. And that's an interesting thing to think about because it's not talking about sexual adultery between partners, but your disloyalty towards God because you have become a disciple, but you still desire what you used to desire, AND YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD GIVE UP, but you're praying for those things. You're you're you're asking God for these things. with the wrong motives. God created you to be a vessel, to be an ambassador, to be a disciple. It's like, yes, God, I really want a a better promotion. I want I want to be married. I want to be dating, BUT IT'S REALLY BECAUSE I WANT TO LOOK GOOD. It those things once again, you can ask for anything. The question is, are you trying to build your life or build up God's kingdom? That's the part that matters here and that's how you can be praying wrong. And I believe that you know when you become a disciple I I truly believe for everyone here who became a disciple you did not become a disciple to do the bare minimum. When you study the Bible you're inspired by the word of God and you SAY I I WANT TO CHANGE MY LIFE. I I WANT TO JUST CHANGE MY LIFE JUST ENOUGH WHERE I CAN STILL DESIRE OTHER THINGS. I don't believe that's why you became a disciple. You didn't become a disciple for the coffee that we have that runs out at the fellowship break. That's not why you became a disciple. &gt;&gt; And we have less coffee, so you can come earlier. Get the coffee before everyone else. You didn't become a disciple because of, you know, my one year experience of preaching. That's not why you became a disciple. You did not become a disciple because Jordan looks handsome every Sunday. &gt;&gt; May maybe that's why Casey's a disciple, but no. I'm kidding. No, no, no. THAT'S NOT WHY SHE'S A DISCIPLE, THOUGH. You became a disciple to live and die for God. &gt;&gt; And so when you pray and when you sing, when you sing as well as pray, is it because you're believing in your heart, you know what? I'm singing. I'm praying. I want to live for you, God. I want to die for you, God. There there's nothing I could have that could bring me any glory. I deserve nothing. And we we have we do have to be careful. We do have to be careful because you can't say that you have a great prayer life and then come here and sing half-heartedly. &gt;&gt; That's not possible. Prayer is supposed to move your heart when you're not alone. And so if you pray when you are alone just to be the same as you are when you're around other people, then you got to go back and pray. You got and you we need we need people in our lives to tell us this. &gt;&gt; One time I was praying with a brother. We're walking and I'm praying, he's praying, and after he prayed, I was like, \"Bro, you got to pray again. Just just pray again.\" He's like, \"What?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, just you just got to pray again.\" And I I was praying with him because another brother said, \"Hey, bro, can you really pray with this brother?\" Okay. And I'm like, \"I wonder why he said that.\" And so as we're praying, I'm like, \"Oh, I see why. Okay, bro. Oh, you got to pray again. Your heart's not right. You you you just want to be glorified in front of other people. You you're you're all all the things that you're praying about all involve you being better. How about you being less? And so and so he's like, \"Oh, wow.\" And so he's never heard that before. And so he prayed again and he started crying and but then he talked to me after like, \"No one's ever told me that before. No one just told me you prayed wrong. You know, we need people in our lives to tell us that we're praying wrong. We need people in our lives tell us that we're singing wrong. And I don't mean &gt;&gt; I Yeah, I don't &gt;&gt; you know, some of us we we we we might clap off beat, you know, we snap off beat. Um we maybe we sing off too. That's not what I'm talking about. And even to the point, you know, there's I will ne I will not say who. But but but sometimes I'll be singing next to a brother or sister and I'm like I can't match the tune. I can't match the song leader right now. But I I start smiling because I'm like, but it doesn't matter because the person next to me, they know it and they're still giving their heart. &gt;&gt; They're not doing it to be performative. they're not doing put on a show and and you talk to them and they know it and they know like you know I love to praise him and it's like and and you can't help but be more fired up because that's what it's all about your hearts and you know we have to be careful right of can't give half our heart while singing all our heart while praying. But even vice versa, you can't be performative when you're around disciples. And then you go back home and then you're just like everybody else. That's not how we should live either. You know, I love the part that it says here. It says he gives us a spirit and because of that, he longs for us with jealousy. It in a relationship, God does not want you to be with anyone else. He does not wants you to be like the world. He doesn't want you to resemble the world. He wants you to be different when you're alone and when you're with me. He's trying to change your hearts. Let's go back John 14. In John chapter 14, we're going to jump around a few verses to get a picture of something. In verse 15, it says, \"If you love me, keep my commands.\" Verse 21, \"Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me.\" Verse 23, Jesus replied, \"Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My father will love them and we will come to them and make our home with them.\" Prayer is meant to lead you to obedience. And it's and we we'll get to this later. Before I get ahead of myself, I want to ask you guys, do you pray for God to move your heart to obedience even when you don't feel like it? That's the I believe that's what we all should be asking for. If there's anything that you can beg for God in prayer is that your heart can be moved by the scriptures. Your heart can be moved to obedience and obeying his word. And we know the saying, we pray because it all depends on God, but we work as if it all depends on us. And we're supposed to pray, but then we HAVE TO THEN OBEY. You you can't just do one and not the other. They go hand. It's like spirit and truth. They go hand in hand. And then continuing in this topic, of course, one of, if not John 3:16, I would say this one is probably one of the more widely popular verses in the book of John. In chapter 15:1, it says, \"I am the true vine and my father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.\" You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. Remain in me as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself. It must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine. You are the branches. If you remain in me, excuse me, and I in you, you will bear much fruit. Apart from me, you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are picked up and thrown into the fire and burns. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you. This is to my father's glory that you bear much fruit showing yourself to be my disciples. What does it say in this passage? To simply remain in Jesus. And revolving around that, we h we see this picture of how God prunes those who can bear more fruit, but he cuts those off who do not bear any fruits. And we cannot produce fruit unless we do remain in Jesus. But what is remaining in Jesus? We just talked about it. Prayer and obedience. If I were to simplify Jesus's life on earth, it was prayer and obedience. He it literally God in the flesh prayed to show us how we should live. And then even when he didn't want to go through with obedience, what did he do? He prayed. He prayed in the garden. Prayer and obedience. And so that is remaining in him. And so fruit, what is fruit? Fruit is the evidence. We people are the branches. So the fruit is the evidence of your prayer and obedience with God. But what does it say? It says you have to it is evidence mean that it can be proven and you prove that your life is in God through your prayer and obedience. Through your prayer, prayer and obedience. What is coming of your life? And he talks about this talks about love. Love as a disciple must be the biggest evidence of your walk especially towards one another. You know to remain in Jesus prayer and obedience you need to do as much as you need to do. Meaning you do not need to do as much as the person next to you need. You do not need to do as much as the person that you want to be needs to do. You need to do as much as you need to do. Every part of the branch needs its own from a micro level its own amount of nutrients. And so, so what does this mean? If we're going to bear fruit and maybe you feel like you're not bearing fruit. Maybe you feel like God where I don't know if there is evidence. I feel like even in my own I can't even prove it to myself right now. I'm truly remaining in you. Well, we have to then change our dosage, your dosage of prayer and obedience. Well, what does that look like? What does it look like to pray more? How does one pray more? Well, I think quite simply, we have to carve out more time. I believe that is the most obvious way to do it. But we have to think about it long term, right? In the day, how can you pray more in the day? Maybe that's simply waking up earlier, staying up later, praying more in the middle of the day. Maybe you're thinking about how could I pray more in a week. Maybe there's one day specifically that you have less time working, less time doing classwork that you say, I'm just going to pray more this day of the week for sure. Maybe in a month, maybe in a month in your work schedule, you're thinking, okay, I know every month I have these many days off or whatever it is. I will pray more in this week in the span of a month or maybe even in a year. you think of when you take breaks, you take long breaks from school or from work. Do you pray more in those times? And then going back to what I was saying, maybe you're praying a lot, but maybe your motives are wrong. I believe that what we should do then is pray with other people. You should pray with people that you may not like praying with so they can tell you, \"Hey sis, hey bro, I love you. I think you should pray again.\" And they're saying that out of love. They're trying to help you help you grow in your walk with God. And how can we how can we obey more? Obedience. I believe that people who love to obey God love taking advice. Not that obeying advice is obedience, but that because you prayed to get your heart right over obeying the scriptures. You then go and get advice about how to do it practically. I believe those who love obedience love advice. is why they just want to learn how could they do more for God? How h how can I give more to God? I I know what I need to do. Sometimes it's hard. I need someone to reveal the the the flat sides of my life, show me where I'm wrong. I want to learn how to do it better. And but it's important as disciples, I believe that we all already know what to do. The Bible says in the Old Testament in Isaiah that you will not need a teacher. But not literally. It literally says, Matthew says, you know, teach those to teach everyone to obey, right? But in a sense of you already know what to do. I believe each of you guys already know what to do. All you need to do is pray to get your heart right and be humble enough to take advice on how to actually practically move forwards. We have to pray and obey. And therefore, we can produce fruits. But if you pray but don't obey, there will be no fruits. THERE WILL BE NO EVIDENCE. AND IF THERE'S NO EVIDENCE, YOU CANNOT GROW. Says that God won't cut you off. You know, the longest living grape vine is about 450 years. If you think about that, that means it was around in the 1600s. It's kind of wild to think about. It survived wars, survived, you know, empires changing, and it's literally still around bearing fruit. Why? because you have to prune the parts that can be more fruitful, the branches that can be fruitful, but maybe some parts of it are dead. You have to cut it off and that's proper taking care of the vine. But for the branch that doesn't bear fruit, you have to cut it off. So a branch that can bear fruit will be there. And I think that's hard for us to accept sometimes of one, God is maybe pruning you and it doesn't feel good. trying to help you bear fruit and it doesn't it doesn't feel good. Someone telling you that your motives are wrong, it's like you can't tell me where my heart is. Well, you're right. I have the scriptures. I'm not telling you anything that you don't already know. And it hurts. It's hard. Pruning is hard. Or maybe even, you know, helping people see that, hey, you know, it's you're not bearing fruit. Something has to change. I don't want you to be cut off. Even if I say nothing, I'm not the one that cuts you off. God does. In Revelation, it talks about how Jesus will take away your lampstand for the congregation. And it's not like he's going to announce it. It's not like he's going to yell it from the rooftops. It's just all of a sudden, a church just becomes a gathering of people. And maybe for you, you become a disciple that just becomes another person, a friend of the world. But I don't want that for you guys. I bet you no one here wants that for you. So, we have to be real with each other. and know how we can move forwards. In verse nine, right after this, it says, \"As the father has loved me, so I have loved you. Now remain in my love. If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my father's commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this. Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I have learned from my father, I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruits. Fruit that will last so that whatever you ask in my name, the father will give you. This is my command. Love one another. You know, Jesus laid his life down for you. But even still, after he did that, he said, \"That is not enough. I want your joy to BE COMPLETE BY OBEYING ME. He He gave you joy, BUT IT IT HAS TO BE COMPLETED BY your remaining in him. Prayer and obedience. He wants to see your joy be completed. I believe for those of us who are giving all of our hearts to praying, obeying his word, living like a disciple every single day, the most important thing that you must believe is that your labor is never in vain. It is never in vain. And that you're toiling as you feel like you're you're going through trouble. But Jesus wants you to know is to continue to remain in him. In verse 16, sorry, in chapter 16 and verse 20, he expands on this. He literally says that very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn into joy. A woman giving birth to a child has pain because of her TIME HAS COME. BUT when her baby is born, she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. So with you, now is now is your time of grief. But I will see you again, and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your in that day. You will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive and your joy will be complete. You know Jesus wants to see your joy be complete through your obedience and your prayer to him. Why? Because the world is trying to take away your joy. The world is trying to fill your heart with trouble. But if you believe that your labor is never in vain and you just simply choose to remain in him, even if he'll only fix it after a while, that's what matters most. You know, your joy will be completed every time you let Jesus fix your troubles. Maybe it's a day, maybe it's a week, maybe it's maybe years. Just let him fix your troubles and remain in him no matter how long it takes. You know, when you obey, but you're full of sorrow, when you sow in tears, the Bible says you will reap with songs of joy. If the Bible says that you will see, imagine one day you get to see Jesus's face. You know, the Bible says that you will be given a new body. And how What what does that mean? You know, like you know, uh an angelic body. What does that look like? I believe that and this is just my opinion still, but I believe we will be like children once again, taking the form of when we were first innocent, but before we understood the darkness of the world. And we come into heaven embracing him. And he wipes away every tear that we have. So we have to obey the word of God and pray that God can do great things through our work of faith when we obey him. Let's close out in chapter 16 29 says then Jesus disciples said now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. Amen. It took 16 chapters. Now we can see that you know all things finally and that you do not even need to make us believe that you have come from God. Do you now believe? Jesus replied. The time is coming and in fact has now come when you will be scattered each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone for my father is with me. I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble but take heart. I have overcome the worlds. And I believe the kingdom is made up of overcomers. It is made up of people who have faith in Jesus Christ and overcome their sin. made up of people who have faith and they deny themselves and carry their cross daily. Made up of those who have faith and they overcome any trouble, any embarrassment, any fear that might come from wanting to obey, BUT THEY OVERCOME IT ANYWAYS because they want to remain in Jesus. And I believe that when trouble comes my way, when trouble comes your way, all you got to do is pray and obey. To God be all the glory.",

    "transcript": "And I was thinking about sickness and it made me start to think of not just physical sickness but spiritual sickness &gt;&gt; and what happens when you don't get well. &gt;&gt; What happens when your your spiritual health isn't good? And so as we talk about today's lesson, I want you guys to reflect on your own spiritual health. &gt;&gt; Let's go to John chapter 11. &gt;&gt; Starting in verse one, it says, \"Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. So the sister sent word to Jesus, \"Lord, the one you love is sick.\" When he heard this, Jesus said, \"This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's son may be glorified through it.\" You know, when you're spiritually sick, but then you get better, Jesus, God is glorifies. &gt;&gt; That's why our spiritual health matters so much. &gt;&gt; And I love it because there's this sickness is bringing an alarm to them and they're trying to bring the same alarm to Jesus. And typically, you would think obviously that Lazarus is not just any kind of sickness, but it could lead to death. And that's why they're so concerned about him. But Jesus said, \"No, no, for him, this will not end in death. Even if it is for a time, it will not end in death.\" And it got me thinking about that being sick, spiritually sick, even to the point of spiritual death. That sometimes if you allow him, it doesn't have to end in your spiritual death. &gt;&gt; So our title today is never stay down. Our first point is it's never too late &gt;&gt; because if there is still time which who knows how much time you have left but you're still alive today it is never too late to get spiritually better. In verse 8 of chapter 11 it says but rabbi they said a short while ago so now he's on his way to go to Lazarus. A short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you and yet you are going back. Then Jesus answered, \"Are there not 12 hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world's light. It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.\" After he said this, he went on to tell them, \"Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up. It is never too late to wake up. It is never too late to recover. And in verse eight, I love what it says about Jesus that or what the disciples are saying to Jesus that he should be cautious going back because he's going back to the place where they previously tried to stone him. And it is, of course, they're they're trying to look out for his physical well-being. And it got me thinking about what is it like to go back to a place that maybe it's not best to go. And I was thinking maybe you've had memories of this in middle school, high school, or college where you embarrass yourself one day and you don't want to go back to school the next day and you don't want to show face. You don't know you and even if it's not true, you feel like everyone's looking at you. &gt;&gt; When I when I was in middle school, I was playing basketball and you know I get a rebound. I remember everyone's trying to take the ball from me. So, I like duck down. I remember uh this kid Derek as I duck down, no one's trying to take the ball from me, but he like sits on my head. And I know it's random, but but I was I'm in middle I'm like 13 years old. I was so mad. I'm like in the sixth grade. So mad that I just started punching him, but I was so skinny it probably just felt like fleece, you know, just like Um, but I don't think it it it was like featherweight versus like, you know, heavyweight, you know, he was a lot bigger than me, so he probably felt nothing honestly. Um, but I was just mad just just just punching him. And and then I don't even remember like what he did after that cuz he didn't really punch back. I think to show that it really didn't affect him. But um but I remember right after that happened, I I I like squat down and I start profusely crying. A &gt;&gt; so I was hitting him and then I start I start crying &gt;&gt; and I remember my my friend Vincent uh then it was that was uh for lunch and the next class he's like Malik yeah like you really showed him but but why were you crying and and then from that day on I was like all right Malik you're never going to get in a fight again cuz if you do you might start crying. And so from that I was I was always I think from that point on I was very passive. I avoided fights at all costs. But but I remember like I was so embarrassed of being like the crier &gt;&gt; going back to class school the next day of just the kid that cried after no one even hit him. I started crying. Um but but that's what it's like. You know you get so embarrassed you you don't want to go and do school work. you don't want to go back to class, go back to school the next day, right? But Jesus, he was never too embarrassed. He was never too timid or too discouraged to display the works of God. And for Lazarus, though there was this imminent threat of he the place that he was going back to, they could stone him. They tried it before. He's like, \"No, no, no. Here's the issue is that Lazarus is asleep. I can heal him.\" So, I am going. It was as simple as that. He didn't over complicate it and he didn't think through the what's ifs. He's like, I know what I can do and I know what he needs. So, I'm going. That's all that I need to think about. And for you guys, I want you to think, what are thoughts that you let take control when it's time to do a miracle? What are thoughts that you allow to dictate your life? dictate your decisions when it's time to do something that brings God glory. You know, we have to drive out fear &gt;&gt; there. There is no love in fear. Drive out discouragements, laziness, and if it's bitterness, you have to forgive and press forwards. And if you're struggling with love, you have to love and press forward. You have to pray as as Chris talked about. Pray, get advice, and press forwards. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; But you can't just stay where you're at, &gt;&gt; right? when healing must be done. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, \"Lazarus is asleep, so therefore, I'm going to wake him up.\" That's literally all he had to consider. Yes, they might kill me, but Lazarus is asleep. I know what matters more. You know, I believe as disciples, we're deep. We want to get into understanding why we do what we do, but don't try to over complicate things as you get deep in your hearts. &gt;&gt; It it the Bible is very straightforward. If there is sin in your life, the Bible says to repent. &gt;&gt; You know, if you're struggling with what to do, like Chris said, PRAY, GET ADVICE, AND THEN MOVE FORWARDS. But don't over complicate your walk with God because you're trying to go deeper. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 20 of chapter 11. It says, \"When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. Lord. Martha said to Jesus, \"If you had been here, my brother would not have died, but I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.\" Jesus said to her, \"Your brother will rise again.\" Martha answered, \"I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live even though they die. And whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?\" \"Yes, Lord,\" she said. I believe that you are the Messiah, the son of God, who is to come into the world. You know, it's interesting to think that Jesus is on his way, of course, to resurrect Lazarus, to raise him from the dead. And including Lazarus, Jesus resurrected three people. It was Gyrus's daughter in Luke 8, and before that, uh, the widow's son in Luke 7, I believe. But there's one person I was thinking about that Jesus didn't raise from the dead that you might think why not. It was his cousin John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; It makes you kind of wonder why. You would think maybe this random guy, this woman's son, this guy's daughter. Why didn't Jesus choose John the Baptist? His his he literally hit his own blood and he was effective bringing people in into Jesus. Why not him? Well, I believe the answer is in Acts chapter 13. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe there's two reasons actually. Uh the first one in Acts chapter 13 in verse 36 speaking of David, it says, \"Now when David had served God's purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep. He was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed.\" You know, you can never outlive God's intended purpose for you. And in the same way, you can never die sooner than God's intended purpose for you. Meaning that if you're alive right now, God still has a plan for you. &gt;&gt; You can never die sooner or live longer. There is still time. And maybe you're questioning, \"Well, I don't know GOD'S PURPOSE.\" WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. to live it out. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To ask questions, to be vulnerable, to talk about what's going on in your life on how to move forward with God's plan for you. And as we talked about last week, it starts in the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It it starts right here with the Bible. You know, if you are still alive, there is time to wake out wake up out of your spiritual slumber. That there is still time to obey God's purpose for you. You know, if we walk in the light, Jesus says that your body will not see decay. And once again, he's talking about spiritually. Amen. But that if you're going through decay in your spirit right now, decay in your walk with God where it almost feels like it's unable to recover, that Jesus can still heal you from that &gt;&gt; and you can move forwards. You know, it is truly never too late. It is never too late as long as you are still alive. Let's go back to John chapter 11. &gt;&gt; John 11. Now we'll pick it up in verse 32. It says when Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, 'Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. Same thing that Martha said. When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and troubled. \"Where have you laid him?\" he asked. \"Come and see, Lord,\" they replied. Jesus wept. Then the Jews said, see how he loved him. But some of them said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\" See, sometimes people only view you as good as your last miracle. Verse 38, Jesus once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with the stone laid across the entrance. \"Take away the stone,\" he said. said, \"But Lord,\" said Martha, the sister of the dead man, \"by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there for days.\" Then Jesus said, \"Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?\" So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me and but I s I said this for the benefit of the people standing here that they may believe that you sent me. When he had said this, Jesus called in called in a loud voice, Lazarus, come out. Then the dead man came out his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, take off the grave clothes and let him go. You know, after four days of his body literally decaying, &gt;&gt; unreoverable in the eyes, in the minds of many, Jesus still healed him. &gt;&gt; It is never too late. And if you recognize right now that maybe your own spirit is starting to decay a little bit, starting to rot a little bit, why? Because it's no longer living anymore. Jesus can still help you recover. And I believe the call here is to get out of your tomb. &gt;&gt; To get out of your tomb. What in your life is causing you to no longer live the life Jesus has in store for you. And if you're still here, you can get out of your tomb. Is there any lingering impurity, resentment, hopelessness, selfishness, cowardice? You know, it's, like I said, it's good to go deep, but let's not get complicated. Let's overcome what is causing our spirits to decay. &gt;&gt; And the second reason why I believe why Jesus healed him is in verse 42. It says that I said this for the benefit of the people standing here. You know Jesus did this not only to bring Lazarus out of the dead but for every everyone that witnessed it to go on to believe in him. You know he did it for the benefit of the people. &gt;&gt; You know do does your life right now bring benefit to those around you? In John 11, same actually the very next verse in verse 45. Therefore, many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in him. You know, if you are a disciple baptized when you were dead in your sins and Jesus resurrected you, your conversion coming into the light can now cause many to believe. &gt;&gt; But what must you do? You must of course never stop sharing, but never stop showing it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then never stop knowing that Jesus has done great things for you. &gt;&gt; But do you live according to that? Do you It does start with faith. Do you fully believe in that? And maybe you feel like, well, my my story, me becoming a disciple, me getting baptized isn't as glorious. You were in your tomb. &gt;&gt; God resurrected you. &gt;&gt; He has done incredible things. Even if you're thinking, \"Well, it wasn't as much.\" But even if it was one sin, God resurrected you from the dead. &gt;&gt; In John 12, in verse 12, it says, \"The next day, the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took the palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, \"Hosana! Blessed is the is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Blessed is the King of Israel.\" Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it as it is written, \"Do not be afraid, daughter Zion. See, your king is coming seated on a donkeyy's colt.\" At first, his disciples did not understand all of this. Only after Jesus was glorified, do they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done for him. Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. Many people because they had heard that he had performed this this sign went out to meet him. So the Pharisees said to one another, \"See this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him.\" Point number two, the world is going after you. &gt;&gt; The world is going after you. And I believe this is in a good way and a bad way. In a good way because you have what they need, &gt;&gt; but in a bad way because you have what they hate. And it is the same thing, the truth. You have what they need, which is the truth. You have what they hate, which is also the truth. And so therefore, the world is going after you. But living at the truth, living by the truth comes at a price. When you continue in verse 23, it says, \"Jesus replied, the hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me. and where I am, my servant also will be. My father will honor the one who serves me. Remember, this is right after resurrecting Lazarus. And that this man who was physically dead and is now raised to life, everyone who saw it now was on one of two sides. They immensely believed or they immensely persecuted. And Jesus is coming off of this last miracle he did and is now saying, \"Yes, physically, but also spiritually. If you hate your life and if you die like a seed, then that is where you know for a seed when a seed dies it becomes a tree. For you to grow into who you're meant to be, you must actually spiritually die and then be raised to a new life. And I think maybe sometimes we hold on to our old life too much. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. We hold on to our old way of thinking a little too much. &gt;&gt; Or sometimes we try to bring it out of the grave. &gt;&gt; We might have left the grave, but sometimes we try to bring it with us. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's how we used to comfort ourselves. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; That's how we used to go through hardship. That's how we used to deal with our own thoughts, our own emotions. And we're not used to recovering through his word. So, we we bring our old ways out of the grave sometimes. But no, you have to die completely. You have to leave it there. &gt;&gt; You have to leave it in the tomb. You know, here Jesus, his final miracle, of course, in John, there's many that he did. John only records seven. This is his final miracle, raising Lazarus from the dead. And the also the idea is that he's saying that this will happen with him. that if unless a kernel of the a wheat falls to the ground that there is no way that it will uh be able to remain a single seed if it stays dead. It has to actually grow, die, produce a tree and then produce more seeds. And so what this means for us is that in order to produce fruit, you must die. &gt;&gt; And that a seed must die if it wants to turn into a tree. And thinking about this, he throws in here in verse 27 something that almost seems unrelated. Says, \"Now my soul is troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour.\" No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Things like giving up your old life. or even harder. Sometimes you have given up your old life, but now you're going through hardship and you're debating whether to go back or to continue to press forward. Jesus is struggling with the same thing. What does he say here? He literally says, \"My soul is troubled and what shall I say?\" He He's trying to find a response to him going through hardship, him going through troubles, whether or not he's actually going to continue to die and glorify God and bring many people to him or go his own routes. And so what is the question? The hypothetical he says, \"Father, save me from this hour. Is is that something that he should think? Is that something that we should think? God, please take me out of this situation. take me out of this hardship. No. &gt;&gt; See, our negative thoughts oppose God's mission when we're looking for a way out. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Here, what is he really saying is, I will not make any excuses. I will not find an excuse to get out of this. Come on. &gt;&gt; And so when you go through hardships, specifically when you go through hardships and you're at a crossroads, maybe you're thinking about sinning or and or do sin, a sin of commission, things that you do or a sin of omission, knowing the good you ought to do and not doing it. You know, how do you respond in these situations? It's like, WELL, THIS HAPPENED. I SIN BECAUSE OF THAT person and and this person did that and I was feeling this and they riled me up and then this was happening in my life and God took this AWAY OR MAYBE SATAN took this away but all this oh makes this this is why I committed this sin or is it the man that Jesus talks about where you fall on your knees says Lord forgive me have mercy on me a sinner &gt;&gt; you have two options make excuses or accept where you're at. &gt;&gt; And if you do accept where you're at, that is when God can heal you. &gt;&gt; You know, when your soul is troubled, the world wants you to be a victim. &gt;&gt; But also, when your soul is troubled, God wants you to be a victor. &gt;&gt; He wants you to overcome the victim of being a victim to the world. I love it. Jesus says, \"Take heart. I have overcome the world. It it is to overcome these same issues, overcome the challenges of giving into the same sin, overcome the challenges of negative thoughts, all the feelings that come with feeling oppressed to overcome them. Jesus went through the same thing, but he overcame the world. You know, never let hardship dictate what you should do. &gt;&gt; We talked about it last Sunday. Let God's word be the filter of your life. &gt;&gt; What you live your life by. Do not lean on your own understanding. And then what what did Jesus say? That man does not live on bread alone, but every word that comes out of the mouth of God. Let the Bible be your filter. Do not let hardship dictate what you should do. You know, the world is going after you. But I believe and Jesus believes that you can overcome the world. If you go to verse 37, it says, \"Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe him.\" This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet, Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed. For this reason, they could not believe because as Isaiah said says elsewhere, he has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts so they could neither see with their eyes nor understand with their hearts nor turn. and I would heal them. Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus's glory and spoke about him. Yet at the same time, many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees, they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue. For they loved human praise more than praise from God's. Once again, we're deep, but we're not complicated. &gt;&gt; If you cannot openly acknowledge your faith, it is because you would rather have praise from God for from people than from God. &gt;&gt; It's that simple. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We can go to the what are the proper steps, but Jesus reveals it directly. &gt;&gt; The source, the core is because you would rather have praise from people &gt;&gt; than from God. You know, it's crazy to think that there are those who would rather stick to cultural norms. There are those that would rather, of course, please people, be praised and lifted up and acknowledged by mankind rather than save their soul and go to heaven. &gt;&gt; And it's such an interesting concept because people say, I even heard it this past week sharing on campus, someone says, you know, if Jesus was right in front of me, then I would believe. But it's an interesting concept to think about. There are actually so many movies that that I believe is really true on this concept that if the world was ending, people would spend their final moments sinning. &gt;&gt; That is so many because because it's like it's so funny people would say that but then not acknowledge that what many people would do is sin &gt;&gt; if the world was ending. And so they say that but it's not true. Jesus said even if the dead is is raised that they still would not believe. And this because of one reason they would rather sin. &gt;&gt; It's that simple. Whether Jesus is in front of you or not, would you rather sin? &gt;&gt; Here, of course, I love that you have these people even after all his signs raising someone from the dead, people still would not believe. And so if you feel unsuccessful in helping people be saved, know you're in a good spot because it was never about that. It was about carrying out God's mission to glorify him in front of many. When you continue in verse 47, if anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words. The very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day. Jesus's words is your ticket in your ticket into heaven. You know, do you obey what he says? &gt;&gt; And yes, it's hard. It's easy to get focused on the outcome. Easy to get focused on the success. You know, you share and you share and maybe you feel like your sharing is going nowhere. Well, that's okay because it was never about the success. &gt;&gt; It was about obeying his words. So therefore, you must keep going, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The world is after you &gt;&gt; is going after you to get you to stop. But there are actually those who are going after you because they want to be a part of this. &gt;&gt; They want what you have. But if if you're struggling with wanting what you have, HOW CAN YOU SAVE OTHERS? How can you save yourself? It is time to recover from spiritual sickness. &gt;&gt; Let's go to John 13, last chapter we'll look at in verse one. It says, \"It was just before the Passover festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and to go to the father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.\" Point number three, love until the end. Love until the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. Continuing in verse two, the evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Scariot, to betray Jesus. Jesus knew that the father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God. So, he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet, drying them with a towel that was wrapped around him. So Jesus here, it reveals that they're they're wearing essentially two kinds of garments, like their street wear, what they wear when they eat, and then when they're at home kicking back, they take off their street wear and they're just wearing regular clothes. But the thing is also taking off your outer garments is you're assuming the position of a servant because you're you're wearing less almost to symbolize that you have less than those around you. So Jesus takes off his outer garments. He has the towel wrapped around his waist and he starts washing his disciples feet in which you wonder you're like wow the Jesus the Messiah the savior of the world is washing those that he has actually saved. But then let's keep going in verse 12 of chapter 13. It says, \"When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. Do you understand what I have done for you?\" He asked them. \"You call me teacher and lord, and rightly so. For that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. How is your servitude towards your brothers and sisters? You know, have you for any reason decided to pull back your hearts? &gt;&gt; Have you for any reason decided to stop serving your spiritual family? You know, I want to lift up uh our young brother Fernando. Where is he? Fernando, &gt;&gt; you know, Fernando, he he came I got baptized a few months ago and he just wants to do more. &gt;&gt; He wants to share more. He wants to be more Bible studies. He wants to sing more. He wants at DVO I I typ we typically do a song and he's like, \"Bro, like and he'll come to me, say, \"Hey, bro. What song should I sing?\" \"Hey, bro, I want to sing this song.\" And he he's he just wants to keep on serving God's people. &gt;&gt; You know, I want to also lift up the echoes. You know, the Echoes, they did ministry for over 20 years. 20 for 25 years. Retired from ministry. Now they Liz is the most successful artist in all of Tampa Bay. &gt;&gt; Truly. And of course, they have, you know, their properties and they've retired from ministry. But yet, when it came to having house churches, they gladly took up the position to serve. You know, of course, I I can't go without talking about the swans. &gt;&gt; The swans, &gt;&gt; they will do everything in their power to make time to talk to you about how to get married. And like if if they don't have time, they will somehow make the time cuz they want to see you guys do well. &gt;&gt; They want to see you guys get close to one another and get close to God. Uh, of course, uh, this past midweek, uh, we were able to use the brother's households. &gt;&gt; And it was it's really funny because Noah leaves the household, but he wasn't even there for our midweek. He went his own midweek. &gt;&gt; And then and then now we're going to be there today for the Super Bowl party at the brother's household. So, it's going to be a lot of fun. Uh, and then lastly, I I can't say it without get talk about encouragement without lifting up my wife. you know, &gt;&gt; she Natalie, she of course, you know, we have Anna, our 2-year-old daughter, and but she she sees the restructuring that we've done, especially within the campus ministry. She like, you know what, one day, at least one day, I'm going to go share at HCC. She has Anna pushing her along in a stroll. You know, at least one other day, I'll try to go to USF as well. And it's great because she wants to serve. She wants to serve the woman's ministry. You know, all at the time that Jesus did this his act of servitude, this act of great love, it's almost crazy to think that that Judas still betrayed him that that he that Judas literally still was stabbed him in the back. And in verse 26 of John 13, it says, \"Jesus answered,\"It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\" Then dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, son of Simon the Scariot. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. With all of this in context, Jesus showing you can still get out of your tomb. If you're spiritually sick, I could recover you if you just leave your old life behind. I can still heal you. Let me serve you. Let me love you. Judas still betrays him in light of all that. And a few verses later, right after this happens in verse 31, it says, \"When he was gone, Jesus said, now the son of man is glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the son in himself and will glorify him at once. My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now, where I am going, you cannot come. A new command I give you. Love one another as I have loved you. So you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another. like Jesus's example here. Can you love others regardless of how they might treat you regardless of how they have treated you? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you still love others? Can you serve when you're not served in return? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you give when you're not given to in return? I want to close out with one passage here in Romans chapter 13. &gt;&gt; This will be the last verse we'll look at. Romans 13, it says in verse 7, \"Give to everyone what you owe them. If you owe taxes, pay taxes. If revenue, then revenue. If respect, then respect. If honor, then honor.\" See, in this passage, it highlights there are things that we do because it's an exchange. You know, we're given goods and so we pay taxes. You know, if we're given a home, we pay rent, right? Like there are things we do in exchange except in verse 8, let no debt remain outstanding except the continuing debt to love one another. &gt;&gt; For whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. The commandments, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and whatever other command there may be are summed up in this one command. Love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore, love is a fulfillment of the law. And do this. Understand the present time. The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. You know, it is by the simple fact that I'm a disciple and you're a disciple that I owe you love. That that is the only factor going into it. I'm a disciple of Jesus. You're a disciple of Jesus. So until we die, I owe you love regardless of what you give or don't give to me. &gt;&gt; That is the love disciples must show one another. And I love how the author says right after that is that do you understand these present times? Do you believe that your salvation is nearer now than it was when you first believed? And if you're having a hard time seeing that, it is time to wake up from your slumber. That Jesus can heal you right NOW BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TIME. As long as you're alive, IT IS NEVER TOO LATE. And because it is never too late and you live according to the truth, the world will be going after you. But no matter what, we must love until the end. &gt;&gt; So never stay down and wake up. To God be all the glory.",

    "transcript": "It says in John chapter 8, we're going to start towards the end of this uh example here. And if most of your Bibles likely have this, but it says uh the earliest manuscripts don't actually have this part of John. And that's interesting because if you like anybody start to question, you want to question so you can understand and understand so you can believe maybe start to question well if it wasn't in the earliest manuscripts the earliest text then why is it in here now? &gt;&gt; And then maybe it leads you to further question is can I trust it? &gt;&gt; Should I believe in this? Well, there are basically two realms of thought for these first 11 verses. one is that it was added in uh later um though it was actually an action that uh Jesus really did and it was uh traditionally passed on orally vocally right but it wasn't added in until later and the gospel they chose to add it in was John uh but the second option is actually that John originally wrote this but the church had concern with people taking it and running with it with an example redemption that it's okay to sin and that they originally they took it out and then they put it back in saying, you know what, that's how it's supposed to be. Either way, I find what happens is it's like, well, why would the Gospels do this? Why would the Bible do this? Why would anyone do this to the Bible? There are actually many books in the Bible to where even though the title of the book might have a person's name, it'll have multiple authors. For example, the book of Jeremiah wasn't actually written by Jeremiah. It was written by his scribe Baroo. Uh, another example is Daniel. In a section of Daniel, Daniel actually didn't write one chapter in Daniel. There is a section exempt to the king of of Persia at that time. And so, the real question isn't, well, should I trust it? What could I put my faith in? The question is, did it happen? Is it true? And that's a whole other question. And sometimes we try to find different excuses why we shouldn't believe in the Bible. But the question isn't, well, how can I prove it to myself? Well, the question is, is it true? Did the people back then trust in it? The people who were most closest to the time that this was written, did they put their trust in it? And the answer is yes, they did. So, we're going to move on after that short little teaching uh towards the end of this in verse 10. And after this example of this woman caught in adultery, these Jewish leaders want to stone her. But it's all actually a trap for Jesus. Jesus says, \"He who has not sinned cast the first stone.\" They all dropped their stones and left. And this is what Jesus says at the very end in verse 10 of chapter 8. Jesus says Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" \"No one, sir,\" she said. \"Then neither do I. Neither do I condemn you. Jesus declared, \"Now go and leave your life of sin.\" See, what does Jesus free you from first and foremost is man's condemnation. He frees you from embarrassment. He frees when you're caught red-handed in your sin. Jesus wants to free you from man's condemnation. Why? Because we've all sinned. Even Even those who you've sinned against, they have sinned. We have all sinned. He frees you from condemnation. But the thing he closes out with is go and leave your life of sin. He has freed you from man's condemnation so that you can choose to no longer live in sin. And it is a choice. You have to decide whether you're going to live in that freedom or go right back to it. Live in the light, live in truth or go back to a life of regrets and embarrassments. But this is important. We're going to hold on to that choosing to no longer live in sin. Because in verse 12, right after it says, 'When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. You see, when you follow Jesus and you choose to no longer live in sin, there is no more darkness when you choose to walk in the light. But once again, it is a choice. You have to choose to walk in the light. Choose to open your heart. Choose to talk about what's really going on. Choose to serve, to give, and value that above being given to. But this scripture, what this makes me think of, of Jesus being the light of the world, immediately made me think of Ephesians chapter 4. In Ephesians chapter 4 in verse 17, the Bible reads, \"So I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do in the futility of their thinking.\" They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity and they are full of greed. That however is not the way of life you learned when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in the accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires to be made new in the attitude of your minds and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. You know, as a Christian, as a disciple, we do not operate like other people in the world. And where does it start? It's not actually just by your actions, just by coming to church, just by sharing your faith or by reading your Bible. It actually starts with your thoughts. It says we are not like Gentiles in the futility of their thinking. See, are you a Christian at the thought level? Are you a Christian at the inward level? And then it shows outwardly. That is what makes disciples stand out. We do not think like other people. We do not operate on the same plane of morality. And we do not live as other people live. We are vastly different because we are citizens of heaven first. &gt;&gt; That that is where our citizenship lies. And we make decisions based off of who we believe that we are a part of. And that's not about your race, your ethnicity, your country, your culture. It's about God in heaven. &gt;&gt; That is the difference. And when Jesus is the light in your life, what does the light do? The light filters out darkness. And I think of that that idea to filter. And uh when uh we were uh living in India for a year uh the India is funny the the Delhi universities where we would mainly evangelize and each college was its own had its own system to where you know how here you have universities playing universities but there the universities have different schools. schools of business, schools of economics, schools of sociology, and they each each of the schools within the university would have a basketball team and play each other. And so to get into the a school like it each section was gated off. So the school of economics was gated off and then like humanities was like gated off. And so to get in you had to prove that you were a student of that specific school. So we would evangelize actually not within the schools but all around us because you couldn't actually get in unless the guards like didn't care because there's guards posted every front. But there some of the schools some of the guards didn't care. And so we would get in and one of the schools that we would get in where the guards didn't care was uh they had this basketball team that Jordan and I we became great friends with. But if you know anything about India, it's hot. It's really hot. It would get to like 110 115 in the summers. It's way more humid than here. And then the air quality is really poor. It's is very poor. For example, here the AQI is maybe 15 20. On a bad day, uh air quality index AQI and a bad day in India is 500. &gt;&gt; And for 500, it says don't go outside. &gt;&gt; Like that's imagine the air quality being so bad. the the news says just don't go outside. Just stay in your house. Like that's how bad I was. Um and so so we would play basketball in this weather with this air quality. &gt;&gt; And you know you're you're not rule number one in when you go to India or actually three4s of the countries on this planet you shouldn't drink their tap water. &gt;&gt; Three yeah three4s of the planet's countries you should not drink their tap water. So when you go to play basketball, you have to bring your own water. One day I didn't bring enough water and it's really hot. So I have to decide, okay, could I die of dehydration right now? I'm out of water. My friend's out of We're all out of water. And so what did everyone else do when they were out of water? They drink not even just from the tap or a water fountain. They drink from a hose. And I'm I'm sitting I'm debating. I'm like, should I should I drink from this hose right now? It already happened. It already happened. Don't even have to do it. This is a past this a this is three years ago. This is a past event. But I did. I did. I did. And And I I could I could feel the murkiness. I could feel the graininess. And and the sad thing is that even they don't want to drink the tap water, but I was like I was so dehydrated. I'm like just a little bit and then I'm done playing basketball. I'm not going. I just need a little bit just to make it to the train station. Um but I did I could feel the murkiness. Let me read to you some things that could happen if you drink unfiltered water. &gt;&gt; Well, here we're going to keep it a G setting. Let me read to you Let me read to you the diseases you can get. You can look up what happens to you when you get these diseases. One, you can get typhoid. &gt;&gt; If you if you drink unfiltered water, you can get typhoid. I'm not going to say it symptoms. You can look it up later. You can get something called choleera. &gt;&gt; It's pretty bad. Wouldn't recommend. You can get hepatitis A and E. &gt;&gt; It goes up to E. Actually, I didn't I learned that. I learned that the other day. How many do they have? How many hepatitises do they have? &gt;&gt; But um and this one this one's crazy. This one you can get something called the the guardia parasites. That just sounds bad, but once again, I'm not going to describe what what happens when you have these things. You'll have to look that up yourself. But it sounds pretty bad. It's really bad, you know, thinking that this is water. We need water. But if you don't filter your water, it could kill you, &gt;&gt; cause terrible diseases, make you bedridden for months, maybe even up to a year, and have irreparable damage if left unchecks. Even though you need water, you have to filter it. Our title today is filter your life. &gt;&gt; Filter your life. Just because you need water, it doesn't mean you can't filter it. What are things that we need as humans that God has put on our hearts? Purpose, dreams, ideas, desires. You have to filter it through the Bible. &gt;&gt; You have to filter your life. Filter the logic you might think you may have, the emotions that you go through in a day, the desires, your dreams, your relationships. Do you filter your life through the Bible? Through God's word. Jesus is the light of the world. He filters out darkness to where there is no darkness at all. He is the perfect filter. &gt;&gt; The absolute perfect filter. When I'm sometimes I look for water, I'm like, what is the most expensive water? Because you look at I don't ever buy it, but I know it's probably filtered pretty well &gt;&gt; because ultimately we want what we need, but we want it to where obviously it it won't kill us. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't filter it, it could. You have to filter your life through the Bible. And I believe only when you start to do that, then the light can dwell in you too. God's light can dwell in you when you filter your life, filter all the darkness out because of the Bible. I have three points for us today of what God's word can do and how it could help us filter out our lives. Point number one is God's word determines spirituality. Your spirituality is not determined by your personality. Is not determined by uh secular worldly characteristics. Is not determined by beauty or fame or by even by how good you can speak or how bad you can speak. is determined by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let's continue in John chapter 8 in verse 25 because I have a little cold my ears, you know how when your ears like they they click almost and everything is muffled? &gt;&gt; So if I get it really loud, that's probably what happens. uh John 8 vers2 it says who are you they asked okay so Jesus basically John 8 I mean really all the gospels he's always debating the Jewish leaders and so here even have through all this preaching they still ask well who are you and it makes me think of how many times we could ask questions that we don't really care to have the answer for &gt;&gt; and we think because we ask the questions that makes us spiritual. &gt;&gt; Just because you ask them, it doesn't mean you want to know. Who are you? They asked. Just what I have been telling you from the beginning. So his message is not any difference. Jesus replied, I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him, I tell the world. They did not understand what he was telling them about his that he was telling them about his father. So Jesus said, \"When you have lifted up the son of man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own, but speak just what the father has taught me. The one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.\" You know, you please your God when your aim is no longer to please yourself. You can't do both. When you become a disciple, it is no longer about what is best for me. What what can I do to push my life forward? It's about what is best for God, what is best for his people. How can I push God's kingdom forwards? And then in verse 30, what does it say? Even as he spoke, many believed him. to the Jews who had believed him. Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\" They answered him, \"We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone.\" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, that's &gt;&gt; pride. When you're prideful, you just say things. You ever have a conversation with somebody and they just say something that is like you almost just want to sit in silence until they just repeat what they just said in their minds? You're like, I know that you know that what you just said was wrong. It says, \"Jesus replied, very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.\" And we know this, but belief is not enough. You have to hold on to Jesus's teachings because it is the truth that sets you free. And here what we learn is that sin opposes the truth. They are incompatible. Sin enslaves you. The truth frees you. They they do not work together. In fact, they are enemies. The complete opposite of each other. And so to be free, you must live to be free of sin, you must live according to the truth. What is the truth here? It says the truth is Jesus's teachings. What does it say in verse 26? That Jesus's teachings are not from his own, but from God. So the truth is God's word. Just plain and simple. That is the truth, God's word. So when you take that, let's go to verse 42. It says, \"Jesus said to them, if God were your father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own. God sent me.\" Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil. &gt;&gt; You want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth. For there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language. For he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell you the truth, you do not believe me. Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me? Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God. I I can't even imagine being on the other side of that d time. Can't even imagine the walls would go up. But anyways, it says that people do not hear, believe, or obey the truth because yes, it says that their father is Satan, not God the father. The father is Satan. But what does it mean when Satan is your father? What does that look like? It means you want to carry out Satan's desires. You want to carry out his desires and not God's. But here's the thing about Satan. Satan's goal is not obvious. He is a liar. Lying is meant to deceive you. It is meant to trick you. It is meant to make you believe that it is truth while living in darkness. If Satan could convince you that you are living in the truth while you are enslaved to sin, he has done his job. &gt;&gt; It's not just that, oh, he is a liar. And those who are in Satan's trap, they know it. They're all atheists. They're all all these other religions. No, if he could get you to think you're falling the truth, he has done his job. &gt;&gt; He is a liar. His goal is to deceive you. And here's the thing with him being a liar that he actually makes promises. He makes promises like hope, promises like comfort, love, joy, happiness, peace, great relationships, you name it. But since he is a liar, he always falls short on his promises. He never fulfills them. But he just wants you to believe that you have them. He wants you to believe that he has them for you if you can live your own way. He wants you to be deceived into his side. But he does that knowing what will win you over. He attacks you from your weaknesses. He understands what can deceive you. You will not give into being a slave to sin. And most times you won't even notice it. He's trying to get you to not know it because he is a liar. That's the that's the whole point of him being a liar. He doesn't want you to know it. He wants you to be tricked into it and living that way. So to live according to the truth is to no longer do what's comfortable is because Satan wants to trick you into what's seducing, what's deceiving, what's not obvious. But when you belong to God, you obey his teachings even when it is hard to. That is the point of opposing Satan, opposing your sin. See, if the Bible determines our spirituality, that means we cannot just do and support and uphold what we think is true to us. &gt;&gt; It is determined by the Bible even when we don't like it. See, if the Bible determines your spirituality today, it means that you do what you know you do not like to do &gt;&gt; and then you go out and you preach it to others. &gt;&gt; You go and tell others. You know, there's so many things. We talk about contribution. We talk about missions. Who here just is actually emphatic about giving away their money? No one. Yet, we still preach it to the world. Who here is emphatic about going to someone they're intimidated by, but maybe they have uh they know the guitar, no pianos. Like, you know, it'd be great if we had people who would come up here and play more guitar or play the bass or play piano. But it's hard because you feel a little embarrassed. Who here is emphatic about feeling embarrassed? No one. But we do it anyways. That's the point of your spirituality being determined by God's words. When you keep reading, and this is the point of that, if your spirituality determined by God's word, you accept your weaknesses. Point number two is God's word crushes your weaknesses. &gt;&gt; God's word crushes your weaknesses. And we'll get to that point in a sec. In John chapter 9 and verse one, the Bible reads, \"As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, \"Rabbi, who sinned? This man or his parents that he was born blind? Neither this man nor his parents sinned,\" said Jesus. \"But this happened so the works of God might be displayed in him.\" \"As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming when no one can work. Excuse me. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. See, Jesus does not believe in blood guilt. That and what is blood guilt? Blood guilt specifically here is that your spiritual faults have physical consequences even if they're not yours. And so the idea of, wow, this man was born blind. Someone must have faltered before God. That was how they thought of the world. But here Jesus says, \"No, no, no. Weaknesses are not just out of a consequence from God.\" Obviously, go back to the book of Job. You have to read the Bible again. But if if you're going through something hard, if you feel like you're weak, if you feel incapable, understand that is so God can work through you. It is so God's power might be displayed through you. But I love that word might. It comes back to what I was saying. It is a choice. Will you allow God to work through your weaknesses? Can you see your weaknesses, identify them, and then filter your life through the Bible so that God can still work through you even when you have a hard time to believe this? And this is I find a weakness that everyone can get into. I included is the trap of thinking I'm a failure. The trap of thinking I am unccapable. &gt;&gt; Well, I have a scripture I want to read. Let's go to Proverbs 16. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16. In verse 18, it reads, \"Pride goes before destruction, a hotty spirit before the fall.\" Why do I read this scripture? Because these concepts of I'm a failure. I am unccapable comes from what we say in modern day is a perfectionist mindset. But here's the issue with a perfectionist mindset specifically and why it's worldly and why it's prideful because it only operates off the fact that you could do it on your own strengths. &gt;&gt; So that's why insecurity comes from pride &gt;&gt; is because you think you can accomplish a goal on your own strengths. You can get closer to God on your own strengths. Whether it be sharing your faith, preaching, having a good Bible talk discussion, having a good de time, whatever it is, you think if I can do this on my own strength. So when you fail, you think that you are a failure, but that's not how God works with weaknesses. So here the this passage is kind of interesting because it says that pride goes before destruction, a hotty spirit which is arrogance before a fall. You know, it says that in another proverb that though a righteous man falls seven times, he gets back up. So the difference between the righteous and the wicked is that the wicked stay down. The wicked give up while the righteous get up again. So when you give into this I'm a failure. I am unccapable mindsets. Is you, no one's putting you down but yourself. This man that was blind was, yes, he was born blind, but he had the opportunity to have God's power work through him and then stand up and to I hope that's not expensive, Tom. I'm sorry. Okay. Uh but but but but here right the issue is that this idea of failing will actually come true when you give into this mindset and you think these thoughts over and over to where you do actually give up. &gt;&gt; And so you actually become a failure not because of anything anyone did to you except for yourself by giving up. So you actually make this scripture come true before it really is. And then by believing in it, by staying down then actually comes into fruition. You become a failure by your own actions deciding to give up. Not because anyone made you a failure but because you decided I am a failure so therefore you believe it and therefore you stay down. See we have to get out of that way of thinking. We can no longer think I am unccapable. I am a failure. I cannot. And here's actually the the thing about it is that when it comes to your weaknesses, you have to accept them. &gt;&gt; But accepting weaknesses is not saying I'm a failure. It's saying, \"Wow, I messed up. I made a mistake. I can learn to do better. I can find a different way. I can try again. I have another day.\" See, it says, \"While it is still day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Meaning that while you are still alive, you can still stand up. You don't have to stay down. You don't have to let being a failure ACTUALLY BE TRUE BY GIVING UP. You can continue to work for God and allow his weaknesses, your weaknesses to be gone through the filter of the Bible so that God's power can shine through you. &gt;&gt; If we go back to John chapter 9, if you go back to John chapter 9 verse 35. So between what we just read in verse 35, we have obviously the whole middle of the chapter. And so Jesus heals the blind man. He goes to the synagogues and he He he gets so bold and so confident that these people that are persecuting Jesus obvious it's so obvious they want to detain Jesus, arrest him, beat him, kill him, whatever it is. And they're they're asking this blind man, who healed you, why'd you do it? By what authority, where did he do it? And then he's like, \"Oh, you're asking all these questions. Do you want to follow him, too?\" And it's it's kind of funny. And so they they they they kick him out of the synagogue. Obviously seeing this man who was blind now be able to see is a testimony against them &gt;&gt; because they're losing their their power comes from their own strength. And so when they see this man who has been healed by the power of God and can now see even though he was blind, they're like, \"No, no, no. This will destroy us.\" So they kick him out. In verse 35, Jesus heard that they had thrown him out. And when he found him, he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\" \"Who is he, sir?\" the man asked, \"Tell me so that I may believe in him.\" Jesus said, \"You have now seen him. In fact, he is the one speaking to you.\" Then the man said, \"Lord, I believe.\" And he worshiped him. Jesus said, \"For judgment I have come into this world so that the blind will see, and those who see will become blinds.\" Some Pharisees who are with them heard him saying this and asked, \"What are we blind to?\" Jesus said, \"If you are blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.\" You see, when you recognize that you need help, the truth will help you. Jesus will help you. He will heal you. But if you claim that you could see and you do not believe that you need help, that is actually when you become blind. And the truth won't help you. It'll destroy you. Let's go to Matthew 21. Matthew 21 it says in verse 42 Jesus said to them have you never read in the scriptures the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone the Lord has done this and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruits anyone who falls on the stone will be broken to pieces. Anyone on whom it falls will be crushed. See, you have to choose today. Willingfully fall on the stone and choose to be humble or stand your grounds. Believe that you're okay and that you don't need help. So, when the stone comes, you will be crushed. You have to choose. Be humble or stay where you're at. Recognize your weaknesses or don'ts. Acknowledge you need help or believe that you are fine. See that you are sick or believe that you are healthy. You have the decision right now to choose how you want to be when Jesus comes in your life. Will you be humbled? Let's go to our last chapter here in John chapter 10. You know, we have to see our weaknesses so that God's power can work through us. And I believe the challenge is that if you don't see it, let someone show you. And then be humble. In John chapter 10, this will be our last chapter here. It says in verse one, \"Very truly I tell you, very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way is a thief and a robber. The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listens to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger. In fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice. Point number three, God's word abhores false doctrine. God, it hates it. God's word abhores false doctrine. That is the number one thing is trying to filter out in your life. What are false beliefs, false teachings, false thoughts that you have that you think that you are following God with? That is the first thing he's trying to get rid of. God's word of course false doctrine. And here Jesus is actually two things in verse 7. He is the gate. And we'll read in verse 11 later. He's also the good shepherd. So he's actually two things in this example. And there is one other kind of person that is two things. First, we have the thieves and the robbers. The thieves and the robbers. Who are they? Who who are the thieves and the robbers in this example? It is those who try to shepherd the sheep but are impersonators. They are not there for the best interest of the sheep. And these same people, these impersonators, these false teachers, these false shepherds we see later on are not just the thieves and the robbers, but they're also the hired hands. So let's go to verse 11 of John 10. says, \"I am the good shepherd.\" The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. So Jesus is the good shepherd. He is the gate here. We are the flock. And those who impose themselves on the disciples as teachers, as guides, but do not actually care for the flock are the thieves and the robbers. They are impersonators. They do not have your best interest in mind. They don't really want you to follow God according to the truth. And they are also hired hands. They presume the position of being a shepherd, but they are not. They are nothing like them. And so who is the wolf? The wolf is Satan. The wolf is our sin. And so when sin comes into your life, you either have the good shepherd that guides you away from it or the bad shepherd, the hired hand, the thieves and the robbers that leaves you alone with the wolf. &gt;&gt; How do you know if you're part of the right church? Is if they help you deal with your sin. And of course, we think like, yeah, I don't want to attend the wrong church, you know, but it's like, but what are you looking for? Are you looking for someone to actually get in your life and tell you what you're doing is wrong, or you once again, you're filtering that by your own thoughts, how you think the church should be, but not actually through the Bible. But here's the thing. We're not even talking about looking for a church. We're already here. We're already here. &gt;&gt; We're at church. Well, we're at Sunday service. Church is every day. But what I mean by that is that if you want this to be God's church, it requires you to put your effort into it and to help dealing with other people's sin. &gt;&gt; So yes, amen. It's not about looking for another church anymore. But are you going to make this and continue this to be God's church &gt;&gt; by you doing other people's sin? And what does that mean? is that you when sin comes into someone's life, when the wolf comes into someone's life, you do not leave them alone. &gt;&gt; You actually help them. You actually guide them. So, it's not just enough to come here and hear about a guy standing up saying you should no longer sin. You have to actually take that and practice it with those around you. That's that's the point of this that that when Jesus says he is as long as he is in the world, he is the light of the world. So what does that mean? When he ascend his body ascends into heaven, he gives us the advocates. He gives us his word and now we're the light of the world. So we have to be the shepherd for other people. We're all shepherds. There you go. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; We're all shepherds. But what does that mean? Is as Travis said, as the Bible says, you value other people's lives above your own. And what does that look like? When sin enters, you get in closer. &gt;&gt; You try to drive the wolf away. You do not let your brother be caught in the claws and the jaws of Satan. You show them the truth. You show them how to obey Jesus's teachings. You know, do you tell the world and people in this room what they do not want to hear? Do you actually shepherd them? Do you actually for yourself accept what you do not want to hear? Do you allow yourself to be shepherded by God's word? When you continue in verse 23, excuse me, of John chapter 10, it says, \"And Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's colony. the Jews who were gathered around him who who they're gathered around him saying, \"How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.\" Here they are again. They're asking questions that they don't really care for the answer for, but they ask it. They they want to seem spiritual. They they seem like they want to know. What does Jesus say? Jesus answered, \"I tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify me, but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. My sheep listen to my voice. I know them and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hands. My father who has given them to me is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of my father's hands. I and the father are one. You know Jesus is God. He is the good shepherd. He is the one. He was lord in our life, the savior of our lives. He we have entrusted our lives to him and he will protect it as long as you follow him. That's the that's the caveat here. says, \"My sheep know my voice and I know them and they follow me.\" Do you follow Christ? That is how he never loses you. It's not because his grip is too loose or his arms are too short. It's based off of will you choose to follow him. It is your decision. You know, many people like the Jews here, they say that they want the truth. But the truth is no good to you if you're unwilling to believe in this. It is no good to you if you're unwilling to believe in it. Jesus knows those who are his when they follow him. So, as long as you follow him, he will never lose you. You will always be guarded by him. Even when you feel like it's hard, you're like, \"Is Jesus really carrying me through here?\" continue on even when it's difficult, even when it's uncomfortable, and he will continue to guard your soul. We can't let distractions, we can't let half-truths, we can't let false doctrine get in our lives and keep us from being a part of God's flock. We need to filter our entire lives through the Bible. filter all teachings that we hear, filter all thoughts that we have, actions that we do through the word of God that you can stand before him confidence when he comes and sees you one day. Stand before him knowing I did all that I could do even when it was hard, &gt;&gt; even when I didn't feel like it. Because it none of it mattered about what I thought. &gt;&gt; It mattered about you, God. &gt;&gt; I want to give everything to you, &gt;&gt; Jesus. will be your good shepherd. He will never lose you if you make the Bible your filter and live by it. To God be all the glory.",

    "summary": "This sermon, titled \"Filter Your Life,\" urges believers to actively filter every aspect of their lives—thoughts, emotions, desires, and relationships—through the Bible, which is God's perfect filter. Speaker Malik Speckman highlights that Jesus frees us from condemnation and offers the truth, which, when followed, sets us free from sin's enslavement. He emphasizes that true spirituality is determined by God's word, not worldly ideals, and that acknowledging weaknesses allows God's power to be displayed. The sermon also warns against false doctrine and the deceptive promises of Satan, encouraging disciples to live as shepherds for others, guiding them away from sin by upholding God's truth.",

However, this freedom is not a license to continue sinning, but an invitation to choose to 'go and leave your life of sin,' highlighting personal responsibility in living a life free from previous sinful habits."

    "book_reference": null,
    "series_number": 4,
    "transcript": "The title of today's lesson is do what you are created to do. &gt;&gt; Do what you're created to do. &gt;&gt; Open up your Bibles to Matthew chapter 22. &gt;&gt; Jesus here, he talks about the most important law that we could have. &gt;&gt; Wow. Matthew chapter 22 starting here in verse 35 the Bible reads one of them an expert in the law tested him with this question. See what happens when you test Jesus you always get an answer from him. You might not like it though. He says teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law. Jesus replied love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like it. Love your neighbor as yourself. All the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments. &gt;&gt; See family, this is our number one purpose in life. &gt;&gt; When God chose you out of the billions of souls here on this earth, this was his purpose for you. to love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your mind, all your soul, and all your strength. And to love your neighbor as yourself. This is our purpose. So, I actually wanted to talk about what it means to have a purpose and what it means to have a mission. &gt;&gt; This what we talked about is our purpose, right? To love God with all of our hearts and to go out and love people. But what's our mission? Matthew chapter 28. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right, sir. &gt;&gt; This is the mission. Matthew 28, you already know. Verse 18. Then Jesus came to them and said, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age. So your purpose is the reason why you do something. It's the reason why you exist. The mission is basically the what and the how of their purpose. In other words, it's the expression of your purpose. And I wanted to ask the singles, how has the expression of your purpose really been? &gt;&gt; Wow. Have you been living out God's purpose for your life? What does the mission look like in your life currently? Something that can happen from time to time, and I believe me, I' I've been there. Sometimes we can lose sight of what the mission really truly is. We can think that, oh, well, I'm just here to get a great job, to build up my life, and then God is God's over here somewhere. But our purpose is to first and foremost just to love God with everything that you've got. And it starts every morning you wake up and you have that precious time with God. Have your quiet times been. Is God really the forefront of your mind? Is God your purpose? See, what's interesting here is that when we have our purpose, the mission kind of just follows through. &gt;&gt; We can often put so much emphasis on what the mission is that we lose sight of the purpose. &gt;&gt; We could think, \"Oh, well, I just I'm here to I'm only here to set up a ton of Bible studies and to be in every single study and to baptize people, and that's the only reason why I'm here.\" I'm like, well, &gt;&gt; that's how you fulfill why you're here, but that's not really why you're here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're here to first and foremost love God and love people. &gt;&gt; And that's the culture I want to establish here in the Tampa church, especially here in the single professionals ministry. Like, first and foremost, we're all about loving God. &gt;&gt; That's what we came here to do. &gt;&gt; That's what won us over when we were first met out. When we that first Bible study when you were asked, \"Do you want to seek God with all of your heart?\" You're like, \"Yes, &gt;&gt; that's our purpose.\" And what's incredible here and what I really wanted to focus on is doing what we are created to do. The first and only point I have is that I am somebody, not a nobody. &gt;&gt; God didn't create you to be a nobody. You are somebody. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 26. Singlehood is a very precious time in your life. &gt;&gt; It's a time where God is able to really show you what you were created to do &gt;&gt; because everybody is here to love God and love people, but you can express it in many different ways with the gifts that God gave you. &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 26 and verse two, the Bible reads, \"Test me, Lord, and try me. Examine my hearts and my minds, for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness. See, God, he's going to reveal things to you, right? Alyssa talked earlier about epiphies. &gt;&gt; You going to have lots of those, &gt;&gt; especially as a single person, right? Because you don't have a spouse and you're just focused on it's just you. It's just you and Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you're having conversations with Jesus, he's going to tell you some things about you. &gt;&gt; He's going to examine your heart. &gt;&gt; He's going to test you. He's going to try you. And what's amazing is that in those times of God examining you, of him testing you and trying you, you get to see more of really what God has created you to be. you already know what your purpose is, but then it's like, okay, I know my mission is also to make disciples, but we don't all have the same professions. We don't all have the same gifts, but God is calling each of us to use those gifts in order to fulfill the purpose for our lives and to go and execute his mission. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Something that we can often focus a lot on, especially as disciples, a lot many of us know what our greatest weaknesses are. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think like that's that's mainly what our D times are focused on. &gt;&gt; At least I I know I've been there. I'm like, man, just disciple me on everything I did wrong. This what can I get a break? Many of us, we know what our greatest weaknesses are. But a question I wanted to present to you all is what is your greatest strengths? Something I actually learned a lot during my time as a single professional was really leaning into what my strengths truly are. These are the things that God specifically put inside of me so that I can go and execute his will. So I'll be vulnerable here family. My greatest weakness is pride. Pride is definitely my core sin. Like without a doubt, I can go from one extreme to the next. It manifests itself either in insecurity, imposttor syndrome, thinking I'm not the right man for the job or I can't do it. &gt;&gt; Or it can go on the extreme other side and it can look like hyperindependence &gt;&gt; like I don't need nobody. It's I could just do this all by myself and I could struggle. I'll be like, God, why do I feel so burdened? or God, why am I oh why I just why am I comparing myself to so many different people? These are my greatest weaknesses. Now, praise God for discipling because I'm able to work on these things. But something else that I also needed to look at was, okay, what are some of my greatest strengths? And the the time that I thought the most about this, I realized that one of my greatest strengths is patience. Like God just You guys ever seen that meme of like God up in heaven and he's putting in different ingredients as he's making and creating a soul and then God accidentally like spills something. He's like, \"Oops.\" My oops was patience. God's like, \"Oh, okay. That's a lot.\" But it manifests itself in a variety of different ways, right? I work as a full-time engineer, so I'm able to solve problems. People think I'm just brilliant genius. I'm not, guys. I'm not genius. I'm not. I'm not the smartest guy in the room. Definitely not. Definitely not the smartest guy in the room. Um, but what it looks like is I'm willing to sit down and stare at a problem in the face until it gets done. &gt;&gt; And me doing that repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, I'm able to grow in my problem solving ability. &gt;&gt; And patience also manifests itself in variety of different ways, right? Through ministry. I'm sure you guys can think of variety of examples, but I don't want you guys focus on my examples. I'm giving you guys an example so you guys can think for yourselves. Think what really is my greatest strength and am I using it to my best potential? And what we're going to be studying out today is we're actually going to look at the progression of a young man, well, at the time it was a young man named Jacob. &gt;&gt; This is going to be our main text for today. We're going to do a a deep dive into the book of Genesis. &gt;&gt; Let's go into Genesis chapter 25. &gt;&gt; Jacob started out and he didn't really know like what he was truly created to do. But over time through tests, trials, and hardship, God showed Jacob exactly what he was created for. Genesis chapter 25 and verse 19. Just to give you a bit of a background context into who Jacob was and where he came from. This is the account of the family line of Abraham's son Isaac. Genesis 25:1 19. Abraham became the father of Isaac. And Isaac was 45, excuse me, 40 years old when he married Rebecca, daughter of Bethule, the Aramaan. and the Aramean from Podam Aram the sister of Laban the Aramean. Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife because she was childless. The Lord answered his prayer and his wife Rebecca became pregnant. The babies jostled each other within her and she said, \"Why is this happening to me?\" So she went to inquire of the Lord. See, that's perfect. You have no idea what's going on in your life. Where's the first place you go to? &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 23. The Lord said to her, oh, praise God he answered, \"Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated. One people will be stronger than the other. The older will serve the younger.\" When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. The first came out. The first to come out was Red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment. So they named him Esau. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; After this, his brother came out with his hand grasping Esau's heel. So he was named Jacob. &gt;&gt; Isaac was 60 years old when Rebecca gave birth to them. &gt;&gt; See what's incredible about this passage here is if you actually look at uh verse 20, Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebecca. Isaac was single for 40 years. &gt;&gt; 40 years. &gt;&gt; Wow. Righteous. &gt;&gt; No. No. &gt;&gt; 40 years. &gt;&gt; Christopher. &gt;&gt; And something that we can fall into as single professionals like, well, I'm only like a half a person. I'm waiting for my other half. Like I need a works. &gt;&gt; It's not at all how it works. &gt;&gt; Work that way. &gt;&gt; Your life is so much more than your marital status. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother. Preach. &gt;&gt; Tell us the truth. &gt;&gt; Write down 1 Timothy 6:6. &gt;&gt; Write it down. &gt;&gt; Godliness with contentment is great gain. As a single professional, you can be godly and you could be content with where God has you. It's only to your disadvantage when you choose to be godly and not content with where God has you in your life. &gt;&gt; It's only to your disadvantage. &gt;&gt; And for some of us, right, if you're not content with where you're currently at, you need to go to God. I was at a really difficult place when I was single. &gt;&gt; I was at a conference one time. I I appreciate our dear friend and brother Michael. &gt;&gt; This was up in uh Mexico City. I was I was cynical. I was sitting in a corner by myself and he comes up. He's like, \"Hey, bro. What's going on?\" I was like, \"Man, I'm just looking at all these dating couples, bro. And I'm just I was miserable. I was like sitting a corner at a conference miserable.\" And Michael checked on me. I appreciate you, bro. He's like, \"You doing okay?\" I'm just like, \"I'm just here and I see all these sisters who said no to me.\" Praise God. There was one who said yes. My lovely wife. &gt;&gt; But what I was what I was looking at, I was not looking at the cross. &gt;&gt; I was not looking at Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, some of us here, we want Jesus to come down and apologize as to why he hasn't given us a spouse yet. &gt;&gt; Cuz your marital status has everything to do with you. But it does not. Christ is so much more. &gt;&gt; So much more. Can I talk to my sisters for just a moment? &gt;&gt; You guys are precious jewels. &gt;&gt; You are God's daughters. &gt;&gt; And he loves you so so much. He is waiting to give you your husband. Like he's like like like God is like God loves you so much. &gt;&gt; He loves you so so very much. Isaiah 54:5 God literally says, \"I am your husband.\" &gt;&gt; And what's incredible about our singlehood is that we really get to just enjoy our lives with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's just him and us. with Jacob. It was just him and the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we're gonna see here that having a spouse doesn't necessarily complete your life. That can actually make it more complicated, &gt;&gt; especially if you're not prepared for it. &gt;&gt; And see, earlier I spoke about what our purpose is and what our mission is. And sometimes, well, we could enter the singles mission. We could think, oh, finding a spouse is my mission now. &gt;&gt; That's my real purpose. Like, I'm here to just I'm here to scout out a nice brother, nice sister, and then after that, I'll get what I need. I I'll get mine. &gt;&gt; Do you have a gets mine mentality? Genesis chapter 25 &gt;&gt; read started here in verse 27. The boys grew up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Come on, boys. Come on, boys. &gt;&gt; This is what we got to do as single freshman. We got to grow up. Grow up. I had something for the sisters. You guys are God's precious jewels. For the brothers, grow up. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's about time. &gt;&gt; THE BOYS GREW UP and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country. While Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents. Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebecca loved Jacob. So, we see here the these boys, they grew up, but God developed their their traits, their characteristics, who they were. Esau was more of an outdoorsy person while Jacob preferred to stay inside with the tents. Personally, I'm more of a Jacob kind of guy. Like I I if I were in these times, these ancient times, I'd be inside them tents. &gt;&gt; I want I I can't I can't deny. But ask yourselves like what are you good at? &gt;&gt; What does God just naturally put inside of you? Like has like has anybody ever asked you like like bro like bro sis how are you how are you able to do that and it's like oh I don't know that's the thing that we really want to tap into. It's these gifts that God gave us so that we're able to serve right in um first Thessalonians 4 verse 11. We'll actually turn there real fast. &gt;&gt; Come on bro. &gt;&gt; Keep your finger in Genesis. We're going to go to 1 Thessalonians. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 11. It says, \"And make it your ambition to lead a quiet life. You should mind your own business and work with your hands just as we told you so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody. I love this pastor so much. I like there are so many pastors that embody the singles ministry, but that like this right it this this is it right here. &gt;&gt; It says we ought to mind our own business and work with our hands. &gt;&gt; The world expects you to have what you want to do for the rest of your life figured out by the age of 18. &gt;&gt; To move out the house and to have like, you know, get your degree or get whatever education, get your job. get your spouse and then live comfortably and die. That's what the world expects of you. But interestingly enough, when we get into God's kingdom, we're really able to use what we have not for ourselves, &gt;&gt; but to please God. &gt;&gt; The purpose of us building up our lives and not being dependent on anybody is to win the respect of outsiders. Who are the outsiders? &gt;&gt; Those outside the church. &gt;&gt; How are your relationships with your co-workers? &gt;&gt; Are you really intentional about the ways you conduct yourself in your workplace? &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter wherever you work. If you work at a um I don't know if you work at a Burger King or if you're working at I don't know if you're working as a janitor or you're working at like a Fortune 500 hedge fund like doesn't matter. The calling is still the same. &gt;&gt; Like the calling is still the same. &gt;&gt; We get to win the respect of outsiders. &gt;&gt; And for those of you wondering like man like I don't even know what I really want to do as a full-time career. Ask yourself, \"What am I good at?\" &gt;&gt; Lean into your strengths. &gt;&gt; If you can use what you're good at and make a career out of it, &gt;&gt; you ain't never gonna throw up money ever again. &gt;&gt; Never again. Because you're already naturally great at it. God gave those things to you for a reason. Now, if you're also on the other front, like, well, bro, I know you said everybody's got gifts, everybody's got talents, but I just I just I'm a nobody. &gt;&gt; I don't have any skills. I don't have any talents. I'm just here. I have no gifts. It's a lie from Satan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God gave you great, incredible gifts. It says in the Bible that you're fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Somebody who's wonderfully made can do wonderful things in the name of God. &gt;&gt; You're not a nobody. &gt;&gt; If this is what you commonly struggle with, I encourage you to study out Romans chapter 12 and 1 Corinthians 12. &gt;&gt; Study those chapters and God will really show you like what you're truly made to do. And raw talent can be turned into usable skills at any point in any time. Write this down singles. Proverbs 22 29. It says that those with great skills will serve before kings. &gt;&gt; And it's so incredible that this is the way that God truly wants to use us in our lives. &gt;&gt; Let's go and head on back over to um Genesis. We're going to go back to Genesis chapter 25 verse 29. The Bible reads, \"Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country famished.\" &gt;&gt; So again, God is highlighting what these uh young men were great at. Jacob stayed inside and he just cooked. We got three habachi chefs in the church. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; They stay inside and they cooked. &gt;&gt; And then we got Esau coming in from the open country. He's he's famished. He's hungry. Verse 30. He said to Jacob, \"Quick. LET ME HAVE SOME OF THAT RED STEW. I'm famished.\" That is also that is why he was called also called Edom. I love the Bible, man. Jacob replied, \"First sell me your birthights.\" &gt;&gt; Treasures. &gt;&gt; So the name Jacob translates to one who grasps the heel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or deceiver. &gt;&gt; Why is Why is grasping the heel associated with deception? because you trip and before you even like realize by the time you're on the ground and you're like in the dust, you know, like you realize somebody grasped your heel. &gt;&gt; And that's what Jacob's name meant. So Jacob, he had a gift or at least something that could be used as a gift, but right here he's just using it for himself. &gt;&gt; What are you using your gifts for? Verse 32. &gt;&gt; Look, I'm about to die. Esau said, \"What good is this birthright to me?\" &gt;&gt; But Jacob said, \"Swear to me first.\" So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthight to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank and got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright. See what happened with both Jacob and Esau. They really didn't know what they were created for. They're both just using their gifts and what God gave them. They're just either squandering it or they're using it to their own advantage. &gt;&gt; Esau squandered his birthright &gt;&gt; which was given to him by God. He just gave it away over a bowl of soup. &gt;&gt; What would you sell for a bowl of soup? Jacob, he's using his natural ability to be shrewd, but he's not being as innocent as a dove. He's just using it to be as shrewd as a snake. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; What are you using your gifts for? &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 27. We're going to fast forward a little bit here. Jacob, because he chose to use his gifts in this manner, we're going to see what what ends up happening. But a little bit of context before we dive into Genesis 27. So Isaac, Jacob's father, he's talking to Esau about finally blessing him, right? Um, so as the oldest son, you had a birthright and you also had a blessing associated with that birthright. He already sold his birthight. That's that's that's done away. That's he's he sold that for his for some soup. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Isaac, he's talking to his son. He's like, \"I'm about to bless you.\" So Rachel, Isaac's wife, hears about this &gt;&gt; and what she does, she grabs Jacob. She says, \"Hey, your dad's better bless your twin brother. We can't let that happen.\" &gt;&gt; So what do they do? They devise a scheme. &gt;&gt; Jacob dresses up like Esau. And Isaac at first, he's he's kind of skeptical. He's like, \"You sound like Jacob, but then you smell like Esau.\" &gt;&gt; All right, I'll go ahead and bless you. All right. Genesis 27:34. &gt;&gt; When Esau heard his father's words, right? So afterwards, um, Jacob comes in, he steals the blessing, and Esau comes walking in expecting to be blessed by his father. &gt;&gt; Verse 34, when Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, \"Bless me too, my father.\" But he said, \"Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.\" Esau said, \"Isn't he rightly named Jacob? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me. He took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing.\" Then he asked, \"Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?\" Isaac answered Esau, \"I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son? Esau said to his father, \"Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father.\" Then Esau wept aloud. &gt;&gt; His father Isaac answered him, \"Your dwelling will be away from earth's riches, from earth's richness, away from the dw of heaven above. You will live by the sword, and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.\" Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of his blessing. Because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, \"The days of mourning for my father are near. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.\" Because Jacob decided to use his talents to only serve himself and not to glorify God, he literally set his own brother against him. How are your relationships with your brothers and sisters? Wow. &gt;&gt; Is there any brother or sister that you've set yourself against? Or has somebody set themselves against you? Is there any reconciliation that needs to happen? Verse 42, our mission and our purpose, right? Well, excuse me. Our purpose is to love God and to love people. Verse 42. When Rebecca was told what her older son, Esau, had said, she sent for her younger son, Jacob, and said to him, \"Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you. Now then, my son, do what I say. Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haron. Stay with him for a while until your brother's fury subsides. When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I'll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day? &gt;&gt; Then Rebecca said to Isaac, I'm disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living. Oh my. &gt;&gt; All right, mama. &gt;&gt; See, even in the Old Testament, it it mattered who you married. &gt;&gt; In the singles ministry, and frankly, every single ministry, we date and marry disciples. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Write that down. &gt;&gt; Everybody write that down. We date and marry only disciples. You see, even back here in the Old Testament, if you married outside of uh what God had deemed appropriate, it was like like Rebecca was miserable. She's like, \"Man, I can't I can't stand my daughters-in-law. Oh my gosh, my son.\" &gt;&gt; And that's the that's the bottom line. We date and marry disciples. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to see what happens further with Jacob. He just set his own brother against him. Esau is now trying to come and murder him. Genesis 28 verse12. Genesis 28 and verse 12. &gt;&gt; The Bible reads, \"He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth with its top reaching to heaven and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. There above it stood the Lord, and he said, \"I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham, and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west, and to the east, to the north, and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you. God has incredible promises for us, does he not, church? &gt;&gt; And what's encouraging is even after Jacob pretty much done went and messed up his whole life, &gt;&gt; God still gave him this promise &gt;&gt; when Jacob was at his lowest. And I don't know about y'all, but I find that madly encouraging because it just goes to show even when we make mistakes in our lives or we choose to use what God has given us and we uh choose to just use it for ourselves, God still gives us an opportunity to change and to repent. &gt;&gt; Not based off of how righteous we are, but simply based off of his promises. My encouragement for for you all tonight is to study out a promise or all the promises that God has given to you. These are things that God says, \"Hey, if you do this, I will do this.\" And it's those promises that we really get to hold on to. And we'll see as Jacob progresses on here with his life, he holds on to these promises. Genesis 29 and verse 14 it says here then Laban said to him you are my own flesh and blood. So Jacob he goes to Padam Aram and he goes and he meets his uncle named Laban. &gt;&gt; Laban was literally the unk right after Jacob had stayed with him a whole month. Verse 15, Laban said to him, \"Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.\" Now, Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, \"I'll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter, Rachel.\" Laban said, \"It's better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.\" See, even Laban had the conviction that we date marry disciples only. Amen, church. &gt;&gt; Verse 20. So, Jacob served seven years to get Rachel. &gt;&gt; But they seemed only like a few days to him because of his love for her. This scripture is very very special to me because I was single for seven years until I met Kiier and married her. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; And I totally understand where Jacob was coming from because they only seemed like a few days &gt;&gt; and I'd wait another seven years if it meant meeting Kiara again. &gt;&gt; But I have to ask the singles here, are you willing to wait? &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, &gt;&gt; hey. &gt;&gt; We just read about somebody was single for 40 years, right? &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; No, just fire up. &gt;&gt; Are you willing to wait? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; If we rush what God is trying to do, it's just it's not going to go well for us. It never ever has. &gt;&gt; When you try to take what isn't yours, God has some heavy discipline coming your way. &gt;&gt; And we're going to see this in the life of Jacob. Verse 21. Then Jacob said to Laban, \"GIVE ME MY WIFE. &gt;&gt; MY TIME IS COMPLETED, &gt;&gt; and I want to make love to her.\" &gt;&gt; So Laban brought together all the people of the palace and gave a feast. But when evening came, he took his daughter Leia and brought her to Jacob. And Jacob made love to her. And Laban gave his servant Zilpa to his daughter as her attendant. When morning came, there was Leia. So Jacob said to Laban, \"WHAT IS THIS YOU HAVE DONE TO ME? I SERVED you for Rachel, didn't I? Why have you deceived me? See, God's going to confront you. &gt;&gt; And there are some times where there is a particular sin that you are struggling with. And sometimes God puts you under somebody who struggles with that same exact thing, but to even higher degree. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Verse 26. Laban replied, \"It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one. &gt;&gt; Finish this daughter's bridal week and then we will give you the younger one also &gt;&gt; in return for another seven years of work.\" &gt;&gt; And Jacob did so. &gt;&gt; Amen. He finished the week with Leia and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. &gt;&gt; See, Jacob got that discipline from the Lord. &gt;&gt; All those times that he chose to misuse his gifts and to use them to deceive, God put him in the presence of an even greater deceiver. &gt;&gt; What you get? When we choose to misuse our gifts, &gt;&gt; there are consequences. &gt;&gt; We're going to fast forward here to Genesis chapter 31. &gt;&gt; Jacob, he's continually working for Laban and Laban just keeps taking advantage of him. &gt;&gt; Genesis 31 and verse4. So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leia came out to the fields where his flocks were. He said to them, \"I see that your father's attitude toward me is not what it was before.\" Golly, we just saw what it was before. How how much how much worse did it get? But God but the God of my father has been with me. See, Jacob, he still held on to God's promises. &gt;&gt; Wow. We're in um Genesis 31 and verse uh verse 5. &gt;&gt; Genesis 31. Uh we're going to start reading in verse 6 says, \"You know that I've worked for your father with all my strength. Yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages 10 times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.\" I love this uh this structure that that Jacob has here as he kind of lists out his hardships. He's like, \"This is happening to me, but God, &gt;&gt; this other thing is happening to me. However, God, &gt;&gt; are you seeing God work through your hardships, &gt;&gt; or are you just focused on the hardship?\" &gt;&gt; Let's drop down to verse 40. Verse 40 says funny. This was my situation. The heat consumed me in the daytime in the cold at night and sleep fled from my eyes. It was like this for 20 years. I was in your household. I worked for you 14 years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks. and you changed my wages 10 times. If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had not been with me, you would have surely sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So, Jacob here, he's on his way. Uh he's about to leave Laben. He's like, \"All right, I'm 20 years of this. Like, I'm like, I'm tired of this, Grandpa. Like, let's get this on over with.\" And I wanted to ask the singles, like, \"What hardships has God put in your life to expose you &gt;&gt; and to help you grow in your character?\" Yeah. &gt;&gt; The reason why Jacob was under Laban those 20 long years was literally just to show Jacob not only what he needed to work on in his character, but also to get him to acknowledge what his purpose was, &gt;&gt; which is to love God and to focus on his promises. What hardships has God put in your life to expose you and to build you up? Genesis 32 in verse three, Jacob's got some more things coming to him. He's on his way over and he has to cross the land to meet his brother, Esau. This same brother that 20 years ago wanted to murder him. &gt;&gt; So, you can only imagine what Jacob's feeling in this moment. You ever had that like that faded meeting? Maybe it's a D time. Maybe it's a really difficult Bible study. Maybe it's a job interview, but just like that that like that one person that you don't want to talk to and you know it's probably going to be an awkward or difficult conversation. Same thing that Jacob had just just multiplied times 10 billion. Genesis 32 verse three. Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. He instructed them, \"This is what you are to say to my lord Esau.\" See, he's being super respectful. Like, my lord Esau, your servant Jacob says, \"I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now. I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my Lord that I may find favor in your eyes.\" When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, \"We went out to your brother, Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and 400 men are with him.\" &gt;&gt; So, you hear this and I can only imagine, but Jacob is quaking in his boots. He was like, \"Oh no, 400 men. Oh my gosh. I can't I can't I can't I don't know. I'd be I'd be scared beyond my minds. But what does Jacob do in verse 9? Then Jacob prayed, &gt;&gt; \"Your hardships are here.\" So they could bring you closer to God, &gt;&gt; not further away. Then Jacob prayed. Oh God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, Lord, you who said to me, he's he's going back to what God told him. Go back to your country and your relatives and I will make you prosper. See family, we always have to rely on God's word &gt;&gt; to get us through our hardships and our challenges. In verse um verse 10 it reads,\"I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan but now I have become two camps. Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me and also the mothers with their children. But you have said, I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted. See, Jacob was just focusing on the kindness and the faithfulness of God. And that's what we ought to focus on. Verse 22. Prior to um this Jacob had sent all his flocks and he said, \"Hey, this is a gift.\" So, he's sending off cattle, sheep, goats, like, \"Okay, these are a gift from my brother almost to like pacify him.\" And he's kind of down to the wire now because he's like he's like, \"Nobody's I don't know.\" Verse 22. That night, Jacob got up, took his two wives, his two female servants, and his 11 sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabok. After he had sent them across to the stream, he sent over all his possessions. So, Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. Sometimes God leaves you alone so you can wrestle with him. Verse 25. When the man saw that he could, excuse me, verse 24, I'll reread it. So, Jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. The man said, \"Let me go, for it is daybreak.\" But Jacob replied, \"I will not let you go unless you bless me.\" The man asked him, \"What is your name?\" \"Jacob,\" he answered. Then the man said, \"Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans, and have overcome.\" Jacob wrestled with God. And in that time of wrestling, God told him exactly who he was and what he was created to do. He says, \"Your name is now Israel because you have struggled with God and with humans, and have overcome.\" Jacob found out exactly who he was, both the good, the bad, and the ugly. But it's only by wrestling with God that we're able to really get the answer of like why are we really here? We know that our purpose is to love God with everything that we've got and to love people and that our mission is to make disciples, but we really need to go to God and figure out, okay, like in my life specifically, what do I need to do in order to do that? Is there any area in your life where you've staved off wrestling with God? &gt;&gt; Is there something you need to wrestle with God with tonight? Are you prolonging it? Genesis chapter 33. We're going to go to verse uh three here. Jacob finally meets Esau after wrestling with God all night. Verse three, he himself went ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him. &gt;&gt; He threw his arms around his neck and kissed him and they wept. See, Jacob, weaknesses and all, he was able to live out his purpose and he found out who God created him to be through the hardships that God placed in his life. &gt;&gt; And I think for us as a single professional's ministry, this is like the optimal time to really figure out like man like what like how can God like how can I be used by God? &gt;&gt; What are my strengths? &gt;&gt; What are my talents? I want to be able to love God, but in my life, like, how how am I able to do that? &gt;&gt; When we live out our purpose, we fulfill God's mission in the end. &gt;&gt; Jacob loved God and he eventually learned how to love people. We see here he reconciled with his brother, Esau, and God did all that he promised him. And so, we're going to come in for a landing here in Deuteronomy chapter 6. Come on. This is um a very very well-known um scripture that the Jews recite regularly. If you meet anybody who's Jewish, ask them if they know the &gt;&gt; Shama. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 6 and verse4 it says here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. This is literally the bread and butter of everything that we do. Everything. So as we continue on and not only in our in our jobs, in our households, with our families, our friends, our lives, let's always remember what our true purpose is. The word um shama in Hebrew means here. So it's like the Jews would recite this prayer over and over and over again. They have it memorized. So if you see a Jewish person, you ask them, \"Hey, can you recite the shama?\" They'll do it all in Hebrew for you if they're a good Jew. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so fitting for us to also to remember this, to always remember this. If we stay grounded with this, there's nothing that can take us out. &gt;&gt; You'll be able to stay faithful for the rest of your life. You'll be able to love people the way that not the way that you want to, but the way that God desires for you to. And so with that, let's not forget why God made you. Because no one can live out this life like you can. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God gave everything to you for a reason. You're special. You're somebody and not a nobody. Thank you guys. To God be all the glory.",

    "transcript": "in John chapter 5. &gt;&gt; I think it is it's very fitting. It's it's a new year. And you know, we we always like new years because we we want things to be new, but a new year is no different than the start of a new week. It's no different than the start of a new day. But we just put a little bit more emphasis on the year. Amen. But really, I hope we understand that when we every time you open the Bible, something new can happen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every time you get together with disciples, something new can happen. &gt;&gt; And I think that chapter 5 is very fitting of where God wants us to land. Coming back uh from the conference starting this year, in verse one of John 5, it says, \"Sometime later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals. Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheep gate a pool which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonates where a great number of disabled people used to lie. The blind, the lame, the paralyzed. One who was there had been invalid for 38 years. When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, \"Do you want to get well?\" Sir, the invalid replied, I have no one to help me into the pool. When the water is stirred, while I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me. Then Jesus said to him, get up, pick up your mat, and walk. At once, the man was cured. He picked up his mat, and he walked. Our title for us today is simply, \"Do you want to get well?\" &gt;&gt; And that title is for you. Do you want to get well? And you're thinking, \"NO, NO, IT'S FOR THE PERSON NEXT TO ME.\" &gt;&gt; Someone just did that JUST NOW. BUT IT IS FOR YOU. Do you want to get well? And there is uh something that must happen if you need to get well. If you want to get well, you must be sick. You must be in need of healing. &gt;&gt; So that's this question. Do you want to get well? It starts with acknowledgment that you are in a sick position. you are in an injured position is do you need do you want healing right now &gt;&gt; I have three points for us point number one is only the broken are healed &gt;&gt; only the broken are healed and to be healed you must acknowledge that you are broken that you need healing that you're in a spot that you cannot continue if you want to consider yourself healthy &gt;&gt; and I love Jesus's question do you want he's the man has been paralyzed for 38 years. Who wouldn't want to be healed? But then it actually got me thinking, is there any any condition is there any factor in anyone's life where they could be unable to walk, unable to do anything, just some weakness in their life? And even think about your own life. Is there any weakness that could be in your life where you're saying maybe I don't want to get healed? Because why would he even ask that? &gt;&gt; I think there's really two things that come to mind. And one of them is a pity party. &gt;&gt; We we people enjoy the attention when you're not doing well. &gt;&gt; And because when you're not doing well, less is expected of you. You get coddled a bit more. People want people give you more attention. And people literally they almost I almost feel like sometimes people like drama in their lives &gt;&gt; because it attracts more attention from other people. Because if you're not doing well, then those who are healthy surround you and they want to help you. And that happens spiritually as well. &gt;&gt; But I find there's a more common reason in verse 14 says later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, \"See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you. When you are healed, there is a new standard for living.\" I find one reason why many people don't want to be healed is because they don't want to live up to that standard. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Of someone who is healthy. Because as long as they're injured, as long as they're sick, then no one is expecting any more from them. Because of course, why would they? But when you are healed, it's like, okay, if you're doing good, if you're healthy, you cannot sin anymore. &gt;&gt; You cannot live how you used to live anymore. You cannot be how you used to be anymore. You can't you God's desire for you is now you're now able to live up to it because you are healed. It's a way different way of life. I find the healthier that you are spiritually, the more that God desires from you, &gt;&gt; the more God wants from you. And to those who are given little, you know, there will be uh if you be entrusted with little, God will entrust you with a little bit more. But if you are trusted with much, God will give you EVEN MORE THAN THAT. It's literally based on how much you have right now. How much God is willing to give you. Are you healthy? And being willing, being healthy is not for yourself, it's for others. Are you willing to be healthy for other people around you? You know, you didn't become a disciple so you can live how you want to live, but then just add morning quiet times to your routine. &gt;&gt; You didn't become a Christian so you can live how you want to live, but you know, all you do is take off time on Sundays to go to church. &gt;&gt; That is not why you became a Christian. That is not why Jesus healed you. And &gt;&gt; so you can repent of your sins, be healthy, and then literally lead other people to have healing as well. &gt;&gt; That is the call for each and every single one of us. &gt;&gt; If you keep reading in verse 24, only the broken are healed. It says in verse 24, very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged, but has crossed from death to life. Very truly I tell you, a time is coming, and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to judge, because he is the Son of Man. Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out. Those who have done what is good will rise to live. And those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned. By myself I can do nothing. I judge only as I hear and my judgment is just. For I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. You know this passage highlights a lot of important things. It says the dead will hear. How could you hear if you're dead? You're already dead. Your time has passed. is is talking about a spiritual death, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Those who are spiritual, those who do not have life yet through Christ's healing, they will have the chance to hear. Those who are in the graves will hear. They will cross from death to life. And there there is a small aspect of course of those who did good. When you die, you will rise and be with God in heaven. But it's based off of what you're doing now. And so you have to ask yourself, are you doing good right now? Come on. &gt;&gt; If you have been healed, are you doing good right now? &gt;&gt; You know, there it will be a day where Jesus's words will call to him all of those who did what is good. &gt;&gt; And I'm just reading the Bible. That's exactly what it says. &gt;&gt; And so, we have to ask ourselves that same question. You know, I if you could remember the times when before you were a disciple or even right now if you're struggling in your sin, what it's like that that feeling of spiritual death, that feeling of there's no way out of this grave that I've dug for myself there. You feel stuck, you feel lost, and and honestly, especially as a disciple, you know it. You know, well, I am in sin and it's just hard to get out sometimes. It's hard to get out of my own head. &gt;&gt; It's hard not to find opinions of those who agree with me and I don't really get the help that I need &gt;&gt; and you get stuck. &gt;&gt; You get trapped. Well, Jesus, his words are calling you right now to hear his voice. That if you are alive, you still have a chance to come out of your spiritual grave and hear his voice and come and be with him. And in verse 30, we have to imitate him in this way. says, \"I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.\" &gt;&gt; You know, I find we have to ask ourselves also, who are we trying to please? Is it our family? Is it our spouses? Is it ourselves? &gt;&gt; Who are we trying to be ple to please? And in order to be healed, we must see where we are broken. It's the only way. If you want healing in your life, you have to acknowledge that you're broken. Acknowledge where you are broken. Acknowledge where and who you are trying to please other people in your life. You know, God is calling you to no longer please anyone but him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it makes sense. He created the universe. He created all that we know. He created all that we don't know. And he created all that we don't even know that we don't even know. &gt;&gt; He created everything. That's &gt;&gt; right. And so if he added you to this world, that means there's a purpose for you. &gt;&gt; And that when you live to please him, it literally by definition, you are living out the purpose that he created for you. And so we no longer please ourselves, but we please him who made us. If we continue in verse 37 of chapter 5, &gt;&gt; we're at we have three chapters to cover. It says, \"And the Father who sent me,\" chapter 5:37, \"And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice, nor seen his form, nor does his words dwell in you. For you do not believe the one he sent. You study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very scriptures that testify about me. Yet you refuse to come to me and have life. See here Jesus is rebuking the Jewish leaders. Those who are supposed to guide everyone else, guide those who don't know the word, guide those who are seeking help and bring them to healing using the scriptures. However, their issue was that they were so focused on being right, so focused on having knowledge that they ended up being wrong. &gt;&gt; It was because that was their focus. How can I be right? How can I have this knowledge? And I find as disciples, as people who roam this earth, we have to be willing to be wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna take it a step further. We have to be willing to be wronged. Let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 6. 1 Corinthians chapter 6, it says in verse 7, the very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? &gt;&gt; I love the verbiage there. Why not rather? As if it's the preference. The preference is to be wronged rather than to justify yourself. The preference is to be cheated rather than the the the fine justification for the person that cheated you. Like it is literally the preference. It is the preferable choice. And that when you choose to take it to court and now it's you and somehow another brother, another person is now your enemy. You have no enemies. We all here. We're all here to follow Christ. &gt;&gt; But when you choose that stance of being offended, taken it personally, it says you have been completely defeated already. &gt;&gt; Let's look at one more. Proverbs 19. Proverbs 19, &gt;&gt; it says in verse 11, \"A person's wisdom yields patience, it is to one's glory to overlook an offense.\" &gt;&gt; It is to your glory to overlook an offense. If someone offended you and objectively said something harmful to you, said something hurtful to you, maybe you feel a sense of church trauma, maybe you feel a sense of like, wow, someone like literally legally did something wrong to me. It is to your glory to overlook an offense. &gt;&gt; And what is the opposite of glory but shame? It is your shame to hold something against somebody. &gt;&gt; It is shame. It is shameful of you to be unforgiven of somebody &gt;&gt; that that is shameful. But if you let go of an offense, it is to your glory. Let's go back to John. And we have to be we we can't be the people that is healed where we have the chance to uh see the scriptures, the chance to take joy seeing the disciples joy. &gt;&gt; We are all given these opportunities, but we can't miss it because we're offended. When you hear the scriptures, you know it's affecting you, but you choose to ignore it because you'd rather be offended. &gt;&gt; You'd rather stay offended. You We can't do that. &gt;&gt; That's right. G. &gt;&gt; And once again, Jesus asking, \"Do you want to get well?\" &gt;&gt; And if you do, no, there's no more excuses. No more No one's What did What did the paralytic say? He says, \"No one's putting me in the water. No one's helping me. They're looking down on me. They don't see my weaknesses.\" But that wasn't his question. Just do you want to get well? &gt;&gt; And if so, pick up your own mats. &gt;&gt; Pick up your own legs. Take responsibility over the legs that you have on your own body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And start the walk. &gt;&gt; The power for you to walk is within yourself and the power that God has given you. &gt;&gt; It doesn't reside in people realizing they offended you. I promise you it doesn't. &gt;&gt; It doesn't reside in somebody finally saying what you need to hear. finally saying the words that you you've been dying to hear. You only forgive them if they say this one sentence. You could overlook that offense and it is to your glory. In John chapter 6, &gt;&gt; I don't know what was happened earlier. Like they're doing like construction up here something. Maybe they'll give us a discount today. I don't know. Just got to ask. Ask and you shall receive. John chapter 6 in verse three. This is uh the fourth sign. If you remember from our first lesson that there are only seven miracles highlighted in John, which is significant compared to the other gospels. And so this is the fourth one. We're already on chapter six and we're over halfway done with all of his miracles. Uh in chapter 6:E3 it says, \"Then Jesus went up on a mountain and sat down with his disciples. The Jewish Passover festival was near. When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philillip, \"Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?\" He asked only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. Philip answered him, \"It would take more than half a year's wages to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite.\" Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, \"Here is a young boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish. How but how far will they go among so many?\" Jesus said, \"Have the people sit down.\" There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down. About 5,000 men were there. Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. When they all had enough to eat, he said to the disciples, \"Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.\" So they gathered them and filled 12 baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. Point number two, only the hungry are fed. Only the hungry are fed. And you know, when I was when I was um a kid growing up in the church, you know, here we have we would have park service. You know, it's a little cold now. It it starts to rain, but we we would have here in Tampa, obviously, great park services. When I was younger, I go to church with my parents. Um I used to live in Arizona. We would have park services on mountains. And so people would like trail up the mountains like if they're really early, park on the bottom and walk up the the mountain for like an hour or two. You could drive up it. And there's no chairs, there's no gazebo, there's no nothing. You just got to bring a chair. You got to sit on a rock. You got to bring plenty of water. And it was awesome. But you know, I was a kid. I wasn't part of like the main service. So, you know, I would go and there's there's no like railing, you know, and so Kids Kingdom is just on the mountain and you just have to have all the Kids Kingdom workers like stationed like in a circle. So, like obviously no one like escapes, you know. But those are like some of the best times of my life, you know? It's you it's just adventure, you know. Here there it's kind of like that. They're having a church service on a mountain and you know they're there and there's 5,000 men if you include women and children definitely over 10,000 thousands of people and Jesus is like we got to feed him and one disciple had a great idea. He went to kids kingdom brought a kid and said how about we take this kid's lunch. &gt;&gt; I got a great idea. Jesus, let's let's take Timmy's lunch here and let's let's figure out what we could do. And you know, sometimes you we just do things like that. You know, we don't know what what we're thinking. But um but it's it's a it's a powerful moment. And I was thinking of uh yesterday uh we helped uh the the Cameron's move and uh Jeie brought some amazing pumpkin bread &gt;&gt; and you know as a disciple you want to you want to put others above yourselves. But you know if there's an extra slice or two it's just first come first serve. &gt;&gt; You you just you had to just be more diligent. just had to get a slice. But um but uh Alex and I, we already had a slice and then we're talking to each other and we're like, \"Dude, you think there's any more pumpkin bread?\" And then we go back and we didn't see any pumpkin bread. The plate was empty. Um I don't I don't remember who said it, but someone was like, \"Oh, there's one more loaf left.\" And we look under the tin foil and there's a whole other loaf. We were so like we're like jumping. We're like we're like like like little kids. We're just jumping and then and why cuz it was a surplus there. There was there were extra loans. There was extra food. But it was so great because um Megan comes up &gt;&gt; and Megan's like, \"Hey, I don't I don't know what you think, but like you know, I don't I'm not sure the cameras had a chance to eat yet &gt;&gt; and we want to save some for them. I don't know if it's a good idea.\" And then and then Alex and I were like, \"Okay.\" We like we like walked like an okay mom moment like okay okay okay mom and and we just like walked away and uh but but it's great it's it's great to have you know sisters to help the brothers out you know u but um but I share that story because when you see a surplus you're like wow there is extra and I can imagine not only that feeling but the fact that they literally should should not have had extra logically it came from nothing. It came from Jesus' power. And there this huge surplus. And I love what it says. It says in verse 11 that he distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. &gt;&gt; There was so much food out of little Timmy's lunch that there was more than enough to go around that enough. It wasn't just as much as they needed, as much as they wanted. &gt;&gt; Jesus has more than you could ever want. That's right. &gt;&gt; More than enough. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; An amazing surplus. And I think not just can he give you more than enough within the church when we help each other. There's the the wisdom in the Tampa church is more than enough. It's a surplus. &gt;&gt; There is a surplus of wisdom amongst the disciples in this church. Um, I I love we we're going into house churches here soon &gt;&gt; and and it's and it's great and I'm I'm I'm I'm pretty excited. I'll save it for later. I don't want to get too uh too ahead of myself, but um but I'm so excited just seeing the the brothers who've been around, seeing the Depws, the Joneses, seeing the Echo, seeing the Swans, people saying, you know what, God has given me a surplus of wisdom. I'm going to give to others. &gt;&gt; And then not just that, we have a surplus of incredible, hardworking disciples &gt;&gt; where it's like, you know what, God has given me youth &gt;&gt; and so I want to use my youth. &gt;&gt; I, you know, Anthony was asking, you know, I don't know how, Malik, you went to the moving event and then you came to Elizabeth's art show. IT'S CUZ IT'S CUZ I'M YOUNG. &gt;&gt; That is what I was thinking. I'm like, it's no like special gift. I'm just young. I just I just I can do it. And so I'm going I'm going to use what God has given me. &gt;&gt; And so for us as we're going into house churches, I believe the call is to use the surplus that God has given you. &gt;&gt; He has given you great talents, great gifts, and is not that you waste it. What What does he say when they're gathering it? Says, \"Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.\" As we go in the house churches, let nothing be wasted. &gt;&gt; If you have a talent in singing, let nothing be wasted. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A TALENT IN SERVING, LET NOTHING BE WASTED. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE GREAT INTEGRITY, WE NEED COUNTERS FOR EACH HOUSE CHURCH. LET NOTHING BE WASTED. &gt;&gt; We have a great surplus here in the Tampa church. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 16. It says, \"When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Kaepernum. By now it was dark and Jesus had not yet joined them. A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. When they had rode about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat walking on the water and they were frightened. But he said to them, \"It is I. Don't be afraid.\" Then then they were willing to take him into the boat and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. You know, I love this passage because Jesus, you know, he he breaks off from them after feeding the 5000 and they go on the boat and Jesus meets them in the middle of the water because he walked on the water. This is his fifth miracle out of seven. And I I love the thing that it says that they see it and I'm sure it's terrifying. They've never seen anything. Why is this person walking on water? And they were terrified. They were afraid. And Jesus says, \"Don't be afraid.\" And I love the very next line. Says, \"Then they were willing to take him into the boat.\" They were not willing while they were still afraid. &gt;&gt; They saw him. They see the miracle, but it wasn't until their fear was dispelled that they were willing to take him onto the boat. You know, our point number two here is only the hungry are fed. And of course, we think how can you eat when you're not hungry? I think a very similar concept goes here. How can you have faith when you're filled with fear? &gt;&gt; And maybe when I said, \"How can you eat when you're not hungry?\" Maybe you thought, \"Well, you can force it down your throat.\" Is that how you force faith in your life? &gt;&gt; You're filled with fear and you're at your limit. There's really not much more you can do, but you just try to force the faith within you. You're going to get burnt out. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You're going to you're going to be discouraged by from your own actions. &gt;&gt; This is not possible. I CAN'T DO GREAT THINGS. YEAH. BECAUSE YOU'RE FILLED WITH FEAR. &gt;&gt; COME ON, BRO. And you know, we we talk about how people say courage is not the absence of fear, which I don't think that is wrong at all. But the amount of times that God says Jesus says do not be afraid is numerous. Hundreds of times in the Bible. And I I even heard someone said like 365 times. Apparently that's a myth. Um but I that that concept comes from like not taking the word fear itself but any relating to it just trying to like get be encouraged even when you don't want to be &gt;&gt; that is probably over 300 times or so but the word do not be afraid is around 100 170 times depending on the translation &gt;&gt; and it's this concept of you can't have faith you can't have Christ come into your boat you can't have Christ come into your life while you're still filled with fear &gt;&gt; and I love the word there is you're not willing to. You don't even want to. &gt;&gt; That when you're filled with fear, the desire is not even there &gt;&gt; because your mind is somewhere else. Your mind is so focused on the problem that instead of having faith in the solution, you have fear in the problem. &gt;&gt; And Christ is saying, \"Don't be afraid. Just be willing. Let me in closer to you.\" &gt;&gt; And you know, fear is it is a feeling. And we're not I'm not saying to bottle up that feeling. We don't tuck away that feeling. And it's not like, well, I'm I'm just so filled with fear. I'm just going to just be faithful. Anyways, you know, on on Friday, we we talked about it uh during our campus DVO is that we have to it's good to acknowledge it. Going back to when you're injured says, do you want to get well? Acknowledge where you are injured. Acknowledge where you are sick. Acknowledge when you feel fear. is good to ignore. No one is saying to ignore it, but you still have to press forward. You still have to advance. And we don't want to force the faith. We want to actually have genuine faith in letting Christ dispel all of our fears. &gt;&gt; What happens when you're filled with fear and you try to force faith? I believe that is many many a reason why people walk away, &gt;&gt; why people fall away, people don't want to continue anymore because they're filled with fear. Maybe it's fear of what people can do to them. Maybe it's fear of maybe advice that he's given to them. Maybe it's fear of where God is taking you and you don't want to be around the same people. You don't want to hear the scriptures anymore. And so when you want to choose a faithful decision, but when you try to combine both, you're discouraged and you don't want to move forward anymore. But what does Christ say? He says, \"Fear not.\" Christ wants you to be well. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Christ wants you to get well. And I want us I want you guys to write something down uh for yourselves. Is what is the fear that is keeping you from letting Christ in closer? here they they feared him. They It was they saw this new thing, this new thing that was being done, this new miracle. Maybe the fear is just something new. I can't move forward because something new is being shown to me. What is the fear in your life that is preventing you from willing willing to be uh allowing Christ coming closer to your life? They felt fear. They weren't willing to bring him into their boat. They felt fear and they literally recognized him, but they weren't willing to allow him in closer. What is the fear in your life that is keeping you from allowing Christ to get closer? &gt;&gt; Let's go to John 6 verse 35. And if you didn't have time to write, um I would encourage you to write later. Uh maybe share with somebody near and dear to you. Uh John 6 in verse 35, we're continuing on. It says in verse 35, when Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry. Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe me. All those the Father will give me will come to me. And whoever comes to me, I will never drive away. For I have come down from heaven not to do my will, but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. You know, I I love this passage, but it's sad to see people literally create false doctrines from this passage. And you can create false doctrines from anything. Literally anything. I've seen it. Um but but here, you know, it's talking about how Christ will not lose those who look to him. He will not lose those who believe in him. And I remember having a long uh study series with a a man and a very incredible humble young man. We're just just going to and we just get together every week. He would bring scriptures. I would bring scriptures on this topic of the elect and how if you are chosen to be elect, then therefore you cannot lose your salvation. It's not possible to lose your salvation. And this is one of the scriptures. And we looked at so many scriptures, but there's really only one that stood out. And it was talking about the unforgivable sin, which is blaspheming the Holy Spirit. And we agreed on what that means. It means that you have the Holy Spirit and you reject it. You deny it by living continuously in sin. &gt;&gt; But that denotes something. It means that in order to reject the spirit that you've been given, it means you must have it. And so he actually acknowledged it before I did. He's like, \"Yeah, you can't deny the spirit unless you have it.\" I'm, \"Okay, so therefore you can have the spirit and then lose it.\" He's like, \"Yes.\" And then we both paused for like 10 seconds. And he's like, \"Oh yeah, I guess you're right.\" And so then after like maybe six weeks of once a week studying the Bible, it was like, \"Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense.\" And why is this concept super important is because Christ won't lose you, but you can choose to walk away from him. &gt;&gt; You can choose to shove him off you. You know, one of this this happened to me for the first time two weeks ago. You know, I as a dad, I just want to smother my daughter Anna just like, you know, and for the first time ever, you know, I'm like, I love you. I love you. She's like, no, no, no. I don't love you. She's two years old. And literally my heart was shattered. I was like, &gt;&gt; but but as a father you realize in that moment I can't say like no you do love me like you know like you have to love me you know like it's not how it works. And I'm like oh Anna like you don't love me. I'm like that makes it makes daddy sad. And she's like and she's like I love you daddy. I was and that's enough, you know, like I can't I can't milk it, you know? It's like you got to put her down. Um but but God's God's not going to SAY LIKE, \"NO, YOU DO love me. I'm forcing your hands.\" Yeah. YOU'RE FILLED WITH FEAR. I'M FORCING FAITH DOWN YOUR THROATS. &gt;&gt; God's not going to do that to you. &gt;&gt; He loves you too much &gt;&gt; to do that to you. &gt;&gt; We'll keep reading here in verse 53. Jesus said to them, \"Truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food, and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. Just as the living father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate mana and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever. He said this while teaching in the synagogue of Capernum. So he's still addressing a lot of the leaders, a lot of the followers, those who were there hearing him preach. And he says something that actually in the first century church many people persecuted the Christians. They thought they were cannibals. They heard like what they they eat this guy's flesh. They eat they drink his blood. And they're very secretive because they obviously meet behind closed doors. And so no one physically saw it happening, but they hear about, hey, you know, did you did you eat his flesh this morning? Man, it was a great time at the service. And people like, what are you talking about? You know, but they literally thought the first step to church, some people thought that they were cannibals. Um but but here that's obviously not what he's talking about. We're talking about the importance of taking communion. And of course we know in the letter in Corinthians how you must examine yourself &gt;&gt; as you take his body as you drink of his blood. And of there is a spiritual aspect of course that you examine yourself. Same thing with baptism. There's a spiritual aspect. Your sins are washed away. You participate in his death. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it is also a command. It it is a command to take communion. Is it a it is a command to get baptized. These are still commands. There is a symbolism aspect of it, but it doesn't take away that Jesus tells us to do so. And this passage of course is hard for those to hear because what is he really saying is that there's no other way besides me. You cannot have life without me. There there is no way you can have healing. There is no way you can have a full life. There's no way you can truly and purely enjoy your life unless I am with you. And that is hard because sometimes you think, well, my life my life could be pretty good without I just make some money. I have some kids. I live the American dream. My life could be good. Wrong. &gt;&gt; You will have no life without Jesus. &gt;&gt; Verse 60, what is their response on hearing it? many of his disciples, his his own followers says this is a hard teaching. &gt;&gt; Who can accept it? Literally, it wasn't it's a hard teaching. It's like Jesus, no one is going to accept that. Who's going to accept what you just said that you are literally the only way that there is no other way? In verse 61, aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, \"Does this offend you?\" I love it. I love it. Jesus was looking for the hungry. It wasn't just about let me let me get all the people who like me. I I just don't want to lose them because they believe in me. If this offends you, why are you still here? &gt;&gt; In verse 66, he he literally doubles down. says, \"From this time, many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.\" In the same chapter where people say, \"You cannot lose your salvation,\" it literally says they turned back and never followed him again. In verse 67, \"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the 12. So literally he fed 5,000 men. If you include women and children, we'll include just women, probably around 10,000. He's and he's also at the synagogue. He's rebuking the leaders. So he has hundreds, probably close to thousands of people there. They all leave. There's 12 left. And instead of like, oh guys, please, we need to save the world. He says, do you want to leave, too? Do you still want to be here? &gt;&gt; You know, it's great. God's church must be built, &gt;&gt; but it must be built right &gt;&gt; with those who actually want to be here. &gt;&gt; Those who are willing to serve him. And I I think the point of this is that we have to believe to a point where there is no plan B. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's there's no bless. There's no other option. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's no other route that we can be healed. There's no other way that we could be saved. That there is literally no plan B. &gt;&gt; That when Elijah took Elisha on to kind of say goodbye to my parents, he says, \"What is that? What is that to me?\" He says goodbye to his parents and then he literally burns everything. &gt;&gt; And it's kind of funny because it's LIKE HIS PARENTS ARE STILL THERE. Like it's like you burned your chores but like there's no oxygen. There's no cattle. Like he just burned it all. They were going to use that. But him there was no plan B. &gt;&gt; It's just moving forwards. And if we're going to be loyal, faithful to the point of death &gt;&gt; is that there's no plan B while we're still living. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's continue on in John chapter 7. &gt;&gt; It says in verse one, I hope AI and Tik Tok hasn't narrowed our attention spans. This is a long lesson, you know. Actually, I u totally off topic here. Um so I'm I'm making it longer by saying this, but I saw someone post like a picture and it was them asking like AI saying, \"Oh, make a picture of how you think that I treat you.\" And it was like like an ethereal hand like coddling a golden orb. That's a weird image. And so I but I'm like I want to try it, right? And so I looked it up. Uh I asked uh chat GBT and I asked Grock. I'm like how do you think that I treat you? And ChatGBT it had like a picture of you know it doesn't know what race I am. &gt;&gt; It had it had a picture of like just like a white guy sitting next to a robot and it's like the white guy had a notebook. The robot smiling. He's like petting the robot and it was like yeah like you know it was like I think that you use me as like a study companion and and then I'm okay it's interesting how do you think most people use you and the next image it generated was the same robot but it had like 10 or 20 hands having single questions like tell me a joke tell me the weather you know all these different commands I'm okay so what's the difference here you know basically what it was saying was that many people use AI for a quick mix. They want a quick answer. Instead of using me to research something deeper, they want a way to a avoid the research, avoid going deeper, and they just want the answer given to them. And I'm and then I asked another question. I'm like, how do you think this will affect the human psyche 20 years from now? And and you know, chat GBT buttered up, so I had to go to Grock. Um I did the same process. It had a very similar image actually and it was saying things like you know in the future probably 20 years from now it'll be rare for someone to have an attention span longer than a Tik Tok video. Um it was saying people will um they they will literally use AI instead of their own memory and that if you want to know a fact you you look it up. You find it real quickly rather than trying to reme memorize it and make it a part of yourself. And I'm like wow that's going to if we're not careful that can destroy the church. &gt;&gt; I I can sit here any lesson over 30 minutes it's like when's lunchtime you know. I'm like I'm like, man, do I got to have like 10-minute lessons or 30 minute services. But but but we're we're in a spiritual war here, guys. &gt;&gt; And it's a it's a battle for your mind. Um back to John 7, though. &gt;&gt; Uh John 7 verse one, it says, \"After this, Jesus went around in Galilee. He did not want to go about in Jerusalem, sorry, in Judea because the Jewish leaders were looking for a way to kill him. But when the Jewish festival of tabernacles was near, Jesus's brothers said to him, \"Leave Galilee and go to Judea so that your disciples there may see the works you do. No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.\" for even his own brothers did not believe him. Point number three, our final point. Only the fearful are deceived. But what do I mean by that? That when you aren't faithful and you're filled with fear, persecution will get to you. &gt;&gt; Persecution will get to you. But that wasn't the case for Jesus. But we have to be careful that we are filled with faith because g his own brothers didn't believe in him. Who here has a family member that disagrees with their Christian walk? A lot of us. We're a little bit more like Jesus because of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh so know that you can persevere as well. Um but but here like literally the all of chapter 7, it just goes through ways that Jesus is persecuted. In verse 12, the crowds are divided on him. In verse 20, they call him demonpossessed. 25 to 27 they question his origins. Where is he really from? In verse 30 they try to seize him and that could mean arrest him, beat him or both. In verse 42 they they question his validity once again. But we're going to jump and come to a close here in verse 45 of chapter 7. It says in verse 457, \"Finally, the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees asked them,\"Wh why didn't you bring him in? No one ever spoke the way this man does.\" The guards replied, \"You mean he has deceived you also?\" The Pharisees retorted, \"Hath any of the rulers of the Pharisees believed in him?\" \"No, but this mob that knows nothing of the law, there is a curse on them.\" Nicodemus who we saw in chapter 3. Nicodemus who had gone uh to Jesus earlier who was one of their own number asked does our law condemn a man without first uh hearing him to find out what he has been doing? They replied are you from Galilee too? Look into it and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee. You know, here it's it's interesting seeing the Pharisees, the Jewish rulers who are filled with fear and their reaction to Jesus. What happens when you're filled with fear? Fear could be from you're hearing a new teaching for the first time and you're like, this goes against everything I believe. Fear could be, you know, someone is trying to give you advice and you're like, can can I really trust them? Or as someone as Elizabeth shared, like fear of being vulnerable. Like God calls all of us to entrust ourselves to one another to fellow believers. But and we all struggle with that. We all struggle. Can I the fear of being vulnerable to another person &gt;&gt; and what happens when you choose to live in that fear feel that fear instead of being filled with faith? &gt;&gt; You literally like they do they literally made stuff up. &gt;&gt; They're saying, \"Oh, he deceived you also.\" Like literally he just said, \"I've never I've never heard someone speak like him.\" So you've been lied to. You've been deceived. You know the other thing is you start to overrationalize. &gt;&gt; You start you start to overthink things. You get in your mind too much when you give into persecution. Uh you start literally accusing people. He he says that there is a curse on them. That's what happens when you're filled with fear. You go to extremes. And we have to be careful one not to let fear control you but two not to let others fear control you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Being a disciple, whether it's uh another disciple, another brother or sister, whether it's someone you're trying to help become a disciple. And there is that fear, there still has to be faith within you &gt;&gt; of like, you know what, I have to be unmovable. And I love what it says about Jesus. What did he do in verse 44? We go one verse back. Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him. to not give in to persecution, you have to be untouchable, spiritually untouchable. Going back to what I was saying, you have to be unoffendable, not take things personally. Uh you have to be unmovable in who you believe Christ is. And yes, be willing to be wrong, but the point is that you're willing to be wrong, but the Bible is always right. &gt;&gt; In Romans, it says, \"Let all men be liars, but God is true.\" And so it's like, you know what? I am willing to be wrong in the pursuit of truth, &gt;&gt; in the pursuit of what is right. And we can't be afraid, but we have to be filled with faith. We have to see our brokenness. We have to get hungry. And with that, we can be well. I have one final practical for us to close out the lesson. &gt;&gt; As I mentioned to the to the campus disciples on Friday, acknowledge and advance. &gt;&gt; Acknowledge and advance. What do I mean by that? No one is saying that you need a certain amount of motivation to live like a Christian. I guarantee you most of your disciplehip you won't. But you still have to acknowledge that. Say, you know what? That's okay. I I might feel fear right now, but I know Christ can carry me through. And what happens when you are compelled by the love of Christ? Where perfect love drives out fear. So, you're not bottling up fear. You're not putting it under the rug. You're choosing seeing the love of Christ and what it can move you to do. And then that fear literally goes away. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have to be hungry. We have to be broken. And when you realize that, it's like, you know, like I I feel this hunger for sin. I feel this brokenness, but I I I want to have a pity party. Acknowledge that. It's like, you know what? Yeah, it's hard to be broken. &gt;&gt; Being tempted is hard. It's like, you know what? But I can move forward with Christ. &gt;&gt; I can choose to have faith in this moment. See, no one is saying you have to be super motivated or that you have to just find and write a feeling. But we have to see our fear. We have to see our weaknesses, see our hunger, acknowledge it, and move forward following Christ. Why? Because only the hungry can be fed. &gt;&gt; Why? Because um you know that if you want to be healed, you have to see that you are broken. And that the only way to be filled with faith is you can no longer be filled with fear and given to deception. That you can move forward. No matter how you're persecuted, no matter who's persecuting you, no matter how close that person is that is persecuting you, that you can make it through. &gt;&gt; That no matter what you're struggling with, even if you've been wronged legally, you can move forward with Christ. Guys, this year is literally a new year. &gt;&gt; Let's let go of any offenses. Let's work on our weaknesses and let us follow Christ and get well. To God be the glory.",

    "summary": "Malik Speckman's sermon, \"Do You Want To Get Well?\", drawing from John chapters 5-7, explores the conditions for spiritual healing and growth. He presents three main points: \"Only the broken are healed,\" emphasizing the need to acknowledge one's brokenness and be willing to live by a new, higher standard after healing, not clinging to a \"pity party\" or avoiding responsibility. \"Only the hungry are fed\" highlights the abundance of God's provision and the necessity of genuine spiritual hunger, not fear, to receive Christ into one's life. Finally, \"Only the fearful are deceived\" addresses how fear, opposition, and a lack of faith can prevent true commitment to Christ, urging listeners to discard fear and embrace full belief without a \"plan B.\"",

      {
        "verse": "John 5:1-9",
        "insight": "The core question, \"Do you want to get well?\", immediately demands an acknowledgment of one's spiritual sickness or injury. The speaker challenges the audience to consider why someone might *not* want to be healed, citing reasons like enjoying attention from a 'pity party' or not wanting to live up to the new standard that comes with being healthy after healing."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 5:14",
        "insight": "This verse illustrates that after spiritual healing, there's a new standard of living: 'Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.' Healing isn't just for personal comfort but empowers one to live righteously, repent of sins, and ultimately lead others to healing, implying greater responsibility and expectation from God."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 5:24-30",
        "insight": "This passage is interpreted spiritually, emphasizing that the 'dead' who hear Jesus' voice are those in spiritual death who gain a chance at life through Christ. It's about spiritual transformation now, and judgment is based on whether one is 'doing good' in their present life after being healed, reflecting a focus on pleasing God rather than self."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 5:37-40",
        "insight": "Jesus rebukes the Jewish leaders for diligently studying scriptures to find eternal life but refusing to come to Him, whom the scriptures testify about. The insight is that being overly focused on being 'right' or accumulating knowledge can paradoxically prevent true understanding and acceptance of Christ, leading to a refusal of life."
      },
      {
        "verse": "1 Corinthians 6:7",
        "insight": "The speaker highlights this verse as a preference: it's better to be wronged or cheated than to engage in lawsuits that create division among believers. This teaching emphasizes choosing humility over self-justification, aligning with the principle of overcoming offense rather than taking things personally and creating enemies."
      },
      {
        "verse": "Proverbs 19:11",
        "insight": "This verse reinforces the idea of choosing glory over shame, stating that it is glorious to overlook an offense, even a significant one. Conversely, it is shameful to hold grudges or remain unforgiving, underscoring personal responsibility for one's emotional and spiritual state regarding others' actions."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 6:3-13",
        "insight": "This miracle demonstrates God's abundant provision, showing that Jesus provides 'more than enough' – not just what is needed, but what is wanted. The speaker applies this to the 'surplus' of wisdom, hard work, and talents within the church, urging disciples not to waste their gifts but to use them for others as God intends."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 6:16-21",
        "insight": "The disciples' initial fear prevents them from immediately welcoming Jesus into the boat, despite seeing Him walk on water. The key insight is that one cannot truly have faith or welcome Christ closer while filled with fear; fear must be dispelled first, acknowledging it but not letting it prevent moving forward in faith."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 6:35-40",
        "insight": "This passage addresses the concept of salvation, clarifying that while Christ won't lose those who come to Him, individuals *can* choose to walk away by rejecting Him. It refutes the 'once saved, always saved' doctrine by emphasizing personal choice and the possibility of denying the Holy Spirit after receiving it."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 6:53-58",
        "insight": "This passage emphasizes the necessity of spiritual communion with Jesus, referring to eating His flesh and drinking His blood as the only way to have life. It highlights that there is 'no other way' to true life, healing, and joy apart from Him, challenging the idea that one can achieve a good life purely through worldly means."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 6:60-67",
        "insight": "This passage shows Jesus' willingness to let people leave if they found His teachings too hard or offensive, even when His followers were numerous. It underscores that God's church must be built with those who genuinely desire to be there, emphasizing a deep, 'no-plan-B' commitment to Christ, not merely a superficial following."

      {
        "verse": "John 7:45-52",
        "insight": "The Pharisees' reaction to Jesus, driven by fear, leads them to question, condemn, and ultimately be deceived by their own prejudices. This is presented as an example of how fear can manifest as resistance to new teachings, distrust of advice, or an unwillingness to be vulnerable, preventing true faith and closeness to Christ."

    "series_number": 6,
    "transcript": "And we're going to go to John chapter 2. &gt;&gt; And John chapter 2, if you remember uh what I talked about last time was that in the book of John only seven miracles are recorded. And the purpose of the book is to produce belief in those who read it. And the author John believed it fit that only seven miracles are needed. And in today we're going to cover three chapters looking at two the first and second miracles that Jesus is doing in the book of John. Uh in chapter two we'll look at the first one. In verse one it says on the third day a wedding took place at Canaan and Galilee. Jesus's mother was there and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the wine was gone, Jesus mother said to him, \"They have no more wine, dear woman. Why do you involve me?\" JESUS REPLIED, \"MY TIME HAS not yet come.\" His mother said to the servants, \"Do whatever he tells you.\" Hereby he stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from 20 to 30 gallons. Jesus said to the servants, \"Fill the jars with water.\" So they filled them to the brim. Then Jesus told them, \"Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.\" Then he told them, \"Now draw, oh, sorry.\" Then they did so, and the master of the banquet taste the water that had been turned into wine, he did not realize where it had come from. Though the servants who had drawn the wine knew, then he called the bride and said, \"Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink. But you have saved the best till now. This is the first of his miracle, miraculous signs Jesus performed in Canaan of Galilee. He thus revealed his glory and his disciples put their faith in him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, it's quite powerful. The last thing said is these men and these people chose to follow Jesus. And it wasn't until after the first miracle, it's like, all right, I can put I can put my faith in Jesus. And it's reassuring BECAUSE AT TIME WE WE FOLLOW, WE KNOW IT'S RIGHT, BUT IT'S WE'RE NOT QUITE sure if we should put our faith in him quite yet. &gt;&gt; And if you're struggling with the level of faith you should be putting in Jesus, I hope that at least this miracle can help you out. &gt;&gt; And here Jesus and his disciples are invited to a wedding, which of course we're disciples. And people use terms like, \"Oh, Jesus preach Bible thumper.\" But Jesus disciples were so cool. They were still invited to parties. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're not just the oddballs now. They're people want them around. They're pretty cool. It's okay to be a cool disciple. And they're invited. And Jesus uh they're just guests. They're attendees to this wedding. And his mother comes along says, \"Hey, there's no more wine.\" And Jesus is like, \"Woman, what why are you involving me, brother?\" And you think about it. Imagine, you know, you're coming to church and Nebby talks about his first time coming. Imagine your first time coming to church and an usher comes up to you and says, \"Hey, we're out of communion supplies &gt;&gt; and you're a visitor.\" Like, \"What does that have to do with me? &gt;&gt; I I just got here.\" And that's essentially what Jesus is doing. He's like, \"I'm I'm going to I'm as a visitor here as well.\" And so, but what does he do? He he still takes a step forward to try to help out. And there are these Jewish ceremonial jars used for washing. And of course we have uh in the Old Testament they would have these huge basins typically about seven of them. And they used it for purification rituals. But here these aren't basins these are jars. And the idea was that over time Jewish rituals turned into something to their own preference. Instead of these huge basins that were talked about in the Old Testament, they would have these jars and instead of using it for purification of sins, they would use it for purifications like in Matthew when it talks about the washing of hands, they would use it for their own purposes. So Jesus is coming at a time when people are already trying to like form the law to their own preferences and but he comes in and he's not conforming to their own traditional way of using these bases. Neither is he here to do exactly what was done in the Old Testament. Jesus takes the jars for his own purpose. Jesus in the first miracle he does the very first sign the symbol the message he's trying to portray is that he has come to change the times &gt;&gt; times will not be as they were in the past times will not be as they are traditionally according to your own preference when Jesus comes he changes everything and when I read this passage I think about well what are the times today what are the times today that need to be changed I think of something like hedenism. Hedenism is the worship of pleasure. How much people just look forward how much they just idolize and all they want is they're looking forward to the weekends. They want to get drunk. They want to smoke after work. They want to, you know, give into lust and purity. They want to gain more money. And people just worship pleasure. &gt;&gt; Those are the times we're in today. &gt;&gt; Another time in the times that we're in today, I find what's common is victimhood. And I share this from of course even personal experience. It isn't everything that we see that we are just victims to our circumstances. Everything that happens to us there's nothing we can do to change it and there's no point in or ownership. In fact, the only way to get over our problems is other people acknowledge them and present that they are the real issue. We're never the issue always other people. And I find the third thing that's common in today's times is how much people love to protect their selfidentity. &gt;&gt; You come up to somebody, you say, \"Hey, I don't think that was very Christlike and say, well, why are you judging me? Who are you to tell me that what I'm doing is wrong? You you can't disciple me. Yes, you have that scripture and that scripture and that scripture and that scripture and that verse, BUT YOU CANNOT TELL me how to be a Christian.\" And people do this for many things. &gt;&gt; And people want to protect their self-identity rather than acknowledge the truth. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And the reality is is that that is the trap of Satan. That is the trap of the world. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If he could distract us from reality with pleasures, if he can get us to be uh so self-absorbed to never acknowledge the truth, if we can never take ownership in our lives, then we'll never make a difference in our lives, let alone in the lives of those around us. &gt;&gt; But Jesus came and he didn't like maybe we do at times, he didn't conform to the pattern of this world. He's the one that changed the world by his own standards, &gt;&gt; by his own measure. And I find, you know, we watching movies, we see these great superheroes like Superman in order to be a superhero, do miraculous things. You have to be born from a planet far away. You just have to have these amazing powers. You or like you watch X-Men, you just have to have this. It is in your DNA. You're born in a certain way if you want to do great things. However, the moment you get the chance to hear about Jesus, you have the chance to change the times. &gt;&gt; It's not about how you're born to be to have be given such magical abilities to preach or to speak. If you hear about Jesus, you have the opportunity to change the times, to change your own life and the lives of those around you. If you only choose not to conform, if you choose not to live how everyone else is living, instead be transformed by Jesus. You know, people are crying for a change right now. And there's no time to waste in victimhood. There's no time to waste in pleasures that distract us. There is no time to waste in trying to uphold our own view of our identity rather than follow the truth. that God actually made a purpose for each and every single one of us. HOW WE CARRY IT OUT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT but the purpose is the same and that is to change the times. Title for us is simply change the times. &gt;&gt; And I hope today by the end of this lesson you realize that God is working within every single disciple of his. every single child of God, God has PUT THE SPIRIT INSIDE OF YOU SO THAT NOW HE can work for the good of everyone who loves him and that he's actually not going to make it easy for you to turn away from him. And he wants you so BAD THAT EVEN IF YOU WERE TO REJECT HIM, it is going to hurt your conscience. Why? Because he wants you to know the truth. He wants you to conform not yourself but the world according to the Bible. And we all have this chance. I have two points for us as we go through these next three chapters. Point number one is stand up for truth. In verse 12 of chapter 2, the Bible reads, \"After this, he went down to Kaepernom with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days. When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple courts, he found men selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. So he made a whip on a courts and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle. He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. To those who sold doves, he said, \"Get these out of here. How dare you turn my father's house into a garden.\" His disciples remembered that it is written, \"Zeal for your house will consume me.\" You know, this passage, we learn something that Jesus comes in and everyone, they're trying to make a profit within God's house, within his temple. And he makes the whip. He drives all the cattle out. He goes to the, you know, old school cash registers and overturns all the money, flips the tables, says, \"Get out of here. How dare you guys?\" Jesus was willing to stand up for truth. And then he quotes this verse, zeal for your house will consume me, which comes from uh Psalmapter 69. Let's go there real quick. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 69. We're going to jump around a few different verses to get the context of why the saying zeal for your household comes to me. It starts in verse one saying, \"Save me, oh God, for the waters have come up to my neck. I sink in the merry depth where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters, the floods engulfing. I am worn out, calling for help. My throat is parched, my eyes fail, looking for my God. Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head. Many are my enemies without cause. Those who seek to destroy me, I am forced to restore what I did not steal. What is the theme of this chapter in the context of zeal for your household consuming? Well, it's a song. It's a prayer of rescue. It's it's asking God, God, save me. &gt;&gt; Lord, rescue me. And one of the things that it says is the the waters I'm being to my neck. I can't feel the bottom of my feet. There's nothing under me. Saying, \"God, I am asked to restore to return things that I did not steal. I am I am misjudged by the things that I do. My enemies, those who hate me, hate me without reason, and they outnumber the hairs on my head. And when you keep reading in verse 7, it says, \"For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face. I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my own mother's sons, for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me. When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn. When I put when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me. Those who sit at the gate mock me. And I am the song of the drunkers. And the author talks about insults, feeling ashamed by those around them, being considered a stranger to your own brothers and sisters. And it even talks about those around him are are making a song about him and how terrible he is. And it says that he is praying. He is fasting. He is putting on sackcloth and nothing changes. Nothing is happening. And maybe you feel the same way today. You're praying to God. God, why is this happening? God, please let it stop. I'm being tormented. I'm being persecuted. I'm undergoing trials. AND IT'S ALL NECESSARY. I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. GOD, please let this end. But in the middle of that, it is zeal for your house consumes me. And I find zeal is more than just giving your heart. But it's giving your heart when it feels like it doesn't make any sense to you. &gt;&gt; Giving your heart, still obeying God when it feels like all odds are against you, even if it means he's not even answering your prayers. &gt;&gt; Do you have that level of zeal today? &gt;&gt; The level of zeal that believes in God no matter what is happening in your life. But then we see what what does he really pray for after his prayer for help isn't exactly working the way he wants. In verse 13 says, \"But I pray to you, Lord, oh Lord, in the time of your favor. In your great love, oh God, answer me with your sure salvation.\" What is the offer praying for? But assurance of salvation. It's like, you know what, God? I I want this all to go away. But even if it doesn't go away, please tell me it's all going to be worth this. Please tell me it's all going to be okay at the end of the day. EVEN IF THIS ALL HAPPENS TO ME TO THE POINT OF DEATH, please make sure I make it into heaven with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I find what's important in times of great distress distress is to know that God always will. God will always protect your soul. For everyone who receives him, believes in his name, and is born of God, God will protect your soul. &gt;&gt; It is only up to you to always remember this. NO MATTER HOW HARD things are, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU'RE TRYING to sway and maybe is this the right thing to do, God will protect your heart if you choose to be a child of God. And it closes out one of the last things that the author says in verse 29. says, \"I am in pain and distress. May your salvation, oh God, protect me.\" And I want to read a very specific translation of this. Maybe you guys have it with you right now. Uh but the translation that hits me the most is the Bible I typically read out of, which is the the CSV. &gt;&gt; But it says that as for me, poor and in pain, let your salvation protect be God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is this prayer to God. God, even if none of this changes, if I run out of all of my wealth and I have nothing and even IF I HAVE NOTHING, MY BODY IS being harmed by those around me. Please protect me with your salvation, God. That is all that I need. And maybe you're questioning today, is salvation the only thing that you need right now? &gt;&gt; Are there other things that you believe that you need? You know, Jesus stood up for truth. Why? Because he knew that the salvation of the Lord was all he need. It wasn't about the approval of man. It wasn't even about embarrassing himself in front of all these people as he's tossing over tables. All he needed to know was that God is protecting him. And we need to do the same. And the reality that God always will. If you're questioning that, know that God always will. He will protect your soul as long as you always choose to follow him and if you endure. So when you go back to John, let's start in chapter three. &gt;&gt; Come on. In chapter 3 and verse one, standing up for truth. It says, \"Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.\" In reply, Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked, \"Surely, he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born.\" Jesus entered. I tell you the truth, unless a man is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, you must be born again. The wind blows wherever pleases. You hear it sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So, it is with everyone born of the spirits. Now, Jesus says that to enter the kingdom, you must be reborn. and he gives what you need to be reborn. You need water and you need the spirits. If I were to pick the most controversial topic you could talk about with anybody who is a profession, I believe this one is this. Do you have to be baptized? &gt;&gt; And I was doing some research on it last night and actually about 65% of the world's professing Christians actually believe you do. So majority of people believe this. And of course there's other things that you have to actually follow Jesus. If you get baptized but you don't follow Jesus isn't getting anything and even if you have to have faith as well. So I'm not saying this is the only thing you need but from a standpoint of the most controversial topic I believe you can talk about. But actually most Christians professing Christians believe that they do. And but if you so on America right because we live in America that it's around 25 to 30% of people who profess to be Christian believe this. And actually of those groups, those who are within the restoration churches are the fourth largest group that believes in this. And so that's literally means that we are of the fourth largest group of 30% of America, American Christians that actually believe that you have to get baptized. &gt;&gt; And it's interesting because you go out and you share and it feels like zero. &gt;&gt; It feels like no one believes in this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's quite interesting because that puts us in Jesus's shoes. He originated this term. At the time he said this, no one believes in it. It was so IF YOU FEEL LIKE no one believes in this fact, that is okay. You're related to Jesus right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's okay to stand UP FOR TRUTH. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? Even if no one believes in it, I'M GOING TO say this. And if no one's ever heard of it, I'm still going to preach it. Jesus professed the truth against all of us. And we have a few verses later the most memorized verse I would say of all time in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; John 3:16. For God's so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but will have eternal life. And it's important. Yes, you do need faith. But when you keep on reading once again in verse 21, it says that but whoever lives by the truth comes into the light so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God. So you CAN HAVE FAITH, YOU COULD EVEN GET BAPTIZED, but do you live by the truth? &gt;&gt; Do you actually obey the words of God? And those who live by the truth, who come into the light, they expose the deeds that they used to do in darkness. You know, we're going into a new year, 2026. And now is really the time, of course, every day. The Lord's mercies, they renew everyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're talking about 2026. It's very symbolic, especially in America, that we really can turn a new page with the new year. &gt;&gt; That's right. that you can actually start this new completely differently. And and to do that, I find what we should really start to do. If you feel like you have any deeds done in darkness, anything still left to confess, confess it today. &gt;&gt; Find a time to let all the deeds of darkness be exposed, bring it into the light and then live according to the truth. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. And people maybe don't even like the side of Jesus of the side that you actually have to have deeds that show that your deeds are done through God. And we like the believing part, even the baptizing part, but how about having deeds that show that what we do is through God, not of our own desire, not according to the pattern of this world, but through God. &gt;&gt; And so in 2026, let's start by exposing the deeds that we have done to start completely in the lights. &gt;&gt; Come on. When you keep reading in the next few verses, Jesus talks about John the Baptist and John the Baptist was incredible. He prepared a way. Even John the Baptist was prophesied about in the book of Malachi. And Jesus continues on as well talking about really how the only way to God is through him. That if you don't believe in Jesus, you don't really believe in God. &gt;&gt; And we as disciples must believe this. No one has a relationship with the father, the creator, without Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it is impossible. &gt;&gt; There is literally no way at all. &gt;&gt; And we'll actually hit that point a bit later, but Jesus continues from Judea. He goes to Galilee and he uh gets tired from his journey, really showing his human nature. Stops by a well. He there's a Samaritan woman. He's in Samaria now. and he asks for water. And he has uh in this next few verses the longest recorded one-on-one conversation that Jesus has in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're going to pick it up in the middle of it in verse 13. It says in John 4. Verse 13, Jesus answered, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty.\" Again, talking about the well and the physical water. But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. And of course, the water he's referring to isn't physical water. That if you have a relationship with Jesus, you'll never have to drink water again. That's not what he's referring to. But he's referring to the spirit that he he gives to people who have the right to become his children. two chapter three chapters earlier in John chapter one and he's talking about if you have this water it springs up to eternal life so it's not just a well it's talking about a spring and what we can closely relate this to is a fountain you know a fountain you have water in the fountain and it shoots up and then it comes down but it recycles itself so this concept of having water spring up into eternal life is that you no longer have to just you drain your spirit and then you go and find another place to gain any more spirits. Back in this time, it was the temple. And even later in the conversation, Jesus is talking to the Samaritan woman and she's like, \"Well, we worship on the mountain, but you worship at the temple.\" But Jesus said, \"Hey, that's actually not how it'll work at all anymore. The spirit will be within yourself and you can rejuvenate yourself to the spirit that lives within you. You no longer have to go to specific places, do certain things to revive that spirit. It is always living inside of you. And this idea of thirst that he's really honing in on is that you will never be thirsty again. He's talking about once again not physical water but the idea of what you need. We physically need water. And when it comes to meeting our spiritual needs, you no longer have to do other things that that try to meet your spiritual needs. All the sins that we can name are trying to fulfill a certain spot in our mind and in our hearts. I think of sins like drugs and alcohol. People use them to escape. They use them to numb feelings or they just use it to feel better than they would without it. And Jesus saying, \"You will never need those again.\" &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Things like immorality, people having sex addictions, pornography, lust, even debauchery, indulging themselves that you say that you will never need those things again. even more intangible things, having pride, selfishness, a hard heart. He is saying you will never need to do those things ever again. And that the life he will give you will actually fill your hearts and it'll fill your minds. Well, you will never need those things once again. And point number two is Christ is who everyone needs. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, &gt;&gt; come on. Do we believe that Christ is all that we need? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; As you read earlier, having the self EVEN IF OUR NOTHING CHANGES physically in our life, as long as we have our salvation, &gt;&gt; the assurance of our souls going to heaven, that is all that we need. &gt;&gt; And I I want to go even further. Do you believe that a relationship with Christ is more important than water? &gt;&gt; Physical water. Come on, believe me. And you know, look at the world today. There is constant war, famine, people dying of dehydration. While others like us, we look out and it's right in front of us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That more important than have if you have the choice of giving the world either of these things, a solution to their famine and disease or Jesus, would you pick Jesus? &gt;&gt; Christ is more important than water. What good is it if you save your life but lose your soul? &gt;&gt; What good is it if you live it every day but you don't make it to heaven? &gt;&gt; Christ is more important than water. &gt;&gt; And we'll read later. He's more important than food actually. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; but we'll keep reading verse 23 of chapter 4. It says in verse 23, \"The time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and truth. For they are the kind of worshippers the father seek. God is spirit and his worshippers must worship him in spirit and in truth.\" There's that must again, right? You have, you know, those who want to enter the kingdom of God must be born again. If you want to be a true worshipper, you must worship in spirit and truth. And I know we look at the word must as a command like I have to do it. But I want to view it in addition in a slightly different way as well. If Jesus commands us to do something, it's because he believes it is possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He believes we have full ability to do it. That even if you're thinking, well, I don't really know how much truth I can worship in that. How much can I really memorize the Bible? As Marley was saying, &gt;&gt; I don't really have great memory like that. Can I really pull up scriptures in my time of need? I I I think I need my phone sometimes. But Jesus fully believes that you can do it. But when you're wondering, well, I can't really give all my heart to singing in my quiet times that there's too much happening in my life. My mind is so clouded by distractions. It makes sense if I don't. Well, he's not only commanding you to do it, but he believes that you can do it &gt;&gt; or he wouldn't command it. So every time you read a command in the Bible, YES, GOD IS SAYING THAT YOU MUST DO IT, but he believes that you can in the first place &gt;&gt; or he never would have said it. &gt;&gt; And God is looking for those in this passage to worship in spirit and truth. He's looking for those who will give him their all to give him everything. So worship in truth, right? Meaning knowledge and action. You know what to do and THEN YOU DO IT. BUT THEN THE WORSHIP in spirit is not just knowing it and doing it, but doing it because you want to do it. &gt;&gt; Because you desire to do it. You have the heart to do it. I'm not just doing it reluctantly. I'm not just doing it for a paycheck when I get into heaven. I'm doing it because I want to. &gt;&gt; And as we even heard in the GN, because we're compelled by the love of Christ. &gt;&gt; And and after this, of course, the Samaritan woman is amazed by other things that Jesus says. She goes to her town and the disciples come on over and they're wondering what was happening. But but Jesus tells them something fascinating in verse 34 of chapter 4 says, \"My food,\" said Jesus, \"is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. Do you not say four months more and then the harvest?\" I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields. They are ripe for the harvest. So not just water. how you don't even need water, but you say, \"HEY, I HAVE food that you know nothing about. I have a different I have a different kind of water and I have a different kind OF FOOD AND ALL YOUR nourishment comes from me, from Jesus Christ.\" And what is his food? It is to do the will of the father and to finish his work. &gt;&gt; You know, the world needs doers of the father's work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the harvest is ripe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, someone looked at you one day and said, \"This person needs Jesus.\" &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And it might have been because they knew you for a long time. Maybe you were childhood friends. Maybe you met them in class. Maybe they just randomly walked up to you on the street and just thought to themselves, \"This person is Jesus.\" And it wasn't enough for them to just share their faith with you. IT WASN'T EVEN ENOUGH FOR THEM to baptize you or DISCIPLE YOU. THAT THEY are still trying to see that work finished within you &gt;&gt; to make it into heaven. But maybe you're SAYING TO YOURSELF, WELL, THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT ME HERE IS NO LONGER HERE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? There are still those in this room that want to see that work finished within me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are still those who are saying, you know what? I will carry the mantle. I will take the torch. I will take it upon myself to see that my brother and sister make it into heaven one day. That's right. &gt;&gt; And someone said it to you, and I'm going to say right now, Tampa is also ready. Come on. The whole city is ready for a harvest. THE WHOLE WORLD IS ready for a harvest. But we have to believe that everyone needs Jesus. And the Samaritan woman, she comes back with her whole town because she was JUST SO SHE SAW IT. SHE SAW THAT EVERYONE NEEDED JESUS. SO SHE LITERALLY TOLD HER ENTIRE TOWN. AND LITERALLY within with her and her leaving, Jesus has a conversation. And then she comes back with her hometown and they want to hear what he has to say. And in verse 39 of chapter 4 says, \"Many of the Samaritans from the town believed in him because of the woman's testimony. He told me everything I ever did. So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged to stay with them and he stayed two days. And because of his words, many more became believers. They said to him, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said. Now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world that there's something that really stood out to me when I read this passage of what caused them to believe. Yes, it was her testimony at first. They brought her uh know she came to them and she told them, right? So it was words, but then when they came to Jesus, it was basically that times too. It was also Jesus's words. And we think about, you know, we didn't quite read it, but in chapter 3, it says that Jesus has the spirit without measure. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus has literally all the power. He could have done great miracles, which he does do for other people. He could have had this great display walking on water, feeding 5,000. He could have shown them something. And Jesus didn't have to. He used his words. In fact, he actually had the spirit without measure. And in all the gospels, it is never reported that he ever spoke in tongues like people say you have to do. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus only did what was necessary. And even in his idea of speaking in tongues and speaking another language, he stayed IN THE SAME AREA. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEAK ANOTHER LANGUAGE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But Jesus did only what he needed to do. And in this case, his words were enough. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I hope we realize how powerful our words are. Wow. &gt;&gt; Words have the power to destroy. &gt;&gt; It says that the tongue is a raging fire. &gt;&gt; Who can quench it? &gt;&gt; But then at the same time, our words have the power to save souls, &gt;&gt; to give life. And of course, this at the end of this chapter, we have the second miracle that is done on the same concept. In verse 49, an official comes to Jesus asking him to come and heal his son. And what does he say? The royal official says, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\" Jesus replied, \"You may go. Your son will live.\" So what does the official do? He comes to Jesus AND SAYS, \"I NEED YOU to leave where you're at. Come to my home, WALK THROUGH MY DOOR, and heal my son.\" And Jesus doesn't even do that. says, \"Just go back. Your son will be healed.\" And what does it say? It says, \"The man took Jesus at his word &gt;&gt; and departed.\" &gt;&gt; See, if we're going to change the times, we have to take Jesus at his word. &gt;&gt; That that is that is belief. That is faith. That's like, you know what? If all I need is salvation to push through my dark times, then so be it. That is all that I need. &gt;&gt; AND EVEN IF ALL ALL I SEE IN JESUS'S LIFE AS WINE shared that even if he went through all this quote unquote failures but still came through triumphantly, same thing for me. &gt;&gt; Nothing can go right and I can still put my faith in him. &gt;&gt; We have to take Jesus at his word. That means no loopholeing, no looking for loopholes. There's no excuses. There is no doubt. It is simply taking him at his word. You know, I believe this is the year that we take Jesus at his word &gt;&gt; more than we ever have before. And then 27 better than that. &gt;&gt; But we take Jesus at his word and the official believed simply by what he said. &gt;&gt; The Samaritans believe simply by what he said. And it actually to change the WORLD IS NOT ABOUT PERFORMING these great miracles. You can change the world by simply what you say. &gt;&gt; You can change the times, change what people are going through. You can change what you are going through. Y &gt;&gt; simply by taking Jesus at his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the miracle that is done here, the point of the second out of seven miracles. What is the message? Is that Jesus's word will bring healing and that is guaranteed. His words will always bring healing. And maybe you think there's another solution. Maybe you think it's like, well, what I need is more me time, more personal time, more time away from people to reflect personally. But what'll heal you is the words of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if you believe that, it can heal you as well. You will find healing in your life. And so, if we're going to change the times, we must stand up for truth and we must know that every single person needs Jesus. And to God be all the Lord.",

This zeal means obeying God even when circumstances are difficult, prayers seem unanswered, and all odds are against you, while holding onto the assurance of salvation."

    "transcript": "Uh please turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 6. &gt;&gt; And today of course you know we we we celebrate talking and we reflect on the the the significance and importance of Jesus's birth. What it means for our lives. what it means for those then and you know you hear the sermons you know the sermon saying you know a star is born Jesus is here and it's so incredible but I want to talk about what actually other disciples have already mentioned a little bit uh not just reflecting on his birth but reflecting on the greatest gift we've been given &gt;&gt; in Romans chapter 6 verse 23 for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. That will be our first scripture celebrating the Christmas season. But the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus. When Jesus was born, and we mentioned it in John chapter 1, God's words, what was invisible became physical and visible for us to see and reflect on. and that his birth was the beginning of something new. And even in Isaiah in ver chapter 43 verse 19, God literally says, \"Look, I am doing something new.\" That when Jesus was born, something new was starting to form. And from the moment he was born to the moment the kingdom came, God Jesus was really wrapping and packaging up a gift that we may receive. And I saw a video the other day of, you know, the people who have invented origami, the Japanese, and they were folding presents like with ease and put like one thing of tape on the end. And I'm like, that's awesome. You know, like me, I take like half the roll of tape. &gt;&gt; And if I could have duct tape, that'd be great. Just kind of just just wrap both ends and like present it. In fact, sometimes I've used so much tape I've kind of forgo forgone that and I just put it in the bag and you just put the wrapping paper on. &gt;&gt; That's just the most simplest way. JESUS'S GIFT REQUIRES NO TAPE. &gt;&gt; There's no wrapping paper. It is something that we have that dwells within us. Eternal life. And this gift is the gift above all gifts. And that is the title for us today. A gift above all gifts. Let's go to first Peter chapter 1. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter chapter 1 in verse three it says, \"Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you. You are being guarded by God's power through faith for a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. You rejoice in this, even though now for a short time, if necessary, you suffer grief and various trials, so that the proven character of your faith, more valuable than gold, which though perishable, is refined by fire, may result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though not seeing him now, you believe in him and you rejoice with inexpressable and glorious joy because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls. And is that not what we're like as kids when when we want, you know, we wake up Christmas morning and we wake up early that there's an inexpressable joy, you know, we wake up our parents, we're like, please like, let's open presents now. It's the same amount of joy receiving the salvation of our souls. But I love this passage. I love this passage says that God's gift can never perish. That God's gift can never spoil. It can never fade. And when you have this gift and you tie it together with faith, it says that God's power shields you. That God's power shields you through faith when you have eternal life. And and this is powerful. But it means something. It means that God does not shield the faithless. If he gives you eternal life, YOU MUST HAVE FAITH with that gift and then he shields you. And that phrase maybe it's a bit hard and maybe sometimes a bit difficult to swallow that wait, God doesn't shield the faithless. What do you mean by that? There's nothing God can do. Well, there are many passages that say that God doesn't or cannot do things. In Hebrews chapter 6, it says, \"It is impossible for God to lie.\" That God does not lie and he will not lie. It is impossible for God to lie. In 2 Timothy 2:13 says that God cannot go against his own nature. And honestly, we're kind of very similar in a sense. I I could I might, you know, if I wake up one day, I will not all of a sudden be Chinese. I cannot go against my own nature. God does not just all of a sudden become evil or become wicked or become a liar. God cannot go against his own nature. Uh Malachi chapter 3 says God does not change. That God is always the same. That that that he we are the ones becoming God always is. Uh it says that God cannot be tempted with evil. James 1:13. So there are things that God cannot do. And one of them looking at this passage is he doesn't shield the faithless because with your faith comes proven character. The NIV says uh your uh the genuiness of your faith, a genuine faith, &gt;&gt; but that only comes through trials, enduring suffering, going through hardship, and that you might receive salvation one day. AND YOU HAVE FAITH, BUT TO ACTUALLY MAKE it to the end, your faith must be proven genuine. And the idea of God shielding those who keep and hold on to their faith through trials is extremely important because without it, that's like saying, \"God, I don't need faith. I don't need to get closer to you. Just give me what I have. Give me eternal life and I'll just move on.\" But you have to actually have your faith be proven genuine. And we'll talk about this for a moment. Go to Matthew chapter 3. Our our first and only point is the gift of genuine faith. The gift of genuine faith. And in Matthew chapter 3, it says in verse 11, I baptize you. This is John the Baptist, right? He prepared the way for Jesus. Says, I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who is coming after me is more powerful than I. I am not worthy to remove his sandals. He himself will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. You know, when we get baptized, we receive eternal life. And it's so great. We we have the gift. We have the imperishable, the most perfect, the greatest gift of all time. We have the Holy Spirit. We we can now actually do things according to God's will. And it's so amazing. But there's one last thing that John says that Jesus baptizes you with, and that's fire. &gt;&gt; That is trials. That is suffering and that you receive the gift of eternal life, the gift of the Holy Spirit and the gift of fire &gt;&gt; because you need that gift for the gift of genuine faith. &gt;&gt; You cannot have genuine faith without fire. And and this is so powerful because this inexpressable glorious joy it what we get from receiving the salvation of our souls, it comes through proving our faith genuine. But we don't like that. We we we say, \"Well, I don't have to prove anything. I don't have to prove nothing to nobody.\" And you hear the phrase, \"Only God can judge me.\" &gt;&gt; And and then we even take it further. We say, \"Well, I receive eternal life that everything I do after being saved is extra. It's a it's a sacrifice. That any giving more of myself, Jesus did all the work on the cross. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT I SHOULD BE DOING. &gt;&gt; And we take on this this pseudo and feel-good spirituality that shouldn't be in our Christianity. &gt;&gt; And is that how you view your Christianity today? &gt;&gt; Is that how you view your disciplehip today? Whether it be, yeah, YEAH, COMING TO CHURCH, THAT'S EXTRA. I don't have to come to church. I don't have to give contribution. I DON'T HAVE TO SHARE MY FAITH. And to a degree, like maybe you're even looking at scriptures proving that to be true. But did Jesus live his life that way on earth? That he came to earth, he was born, and basically let's say let's say we we lived out that theology that Jesus was born and then he had 33 years could have done nothing and died on the cross and that would have been fine. But Jesus, God in the flesh, took on human nature so that we could understand how to walk in his ways. &gt;&gt; He came literally as a servant. &gt;&gt; And he chose that role as a servant. A servant doesn't view their tasks, their duty as a servant as extra. If anything, if anything, when a servant is done with all that they are doing, they they say, \"Wow, it was only my duty.\" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is my role as a servant. And for us, if Jesus, God in the flesh with all of his might, all of his power, if that is who he is, yet he views all of his creation, every single one of us, he views our lives as more valuable than his own. How much more should we? And I find this to be true that the level of our devotion is directly related to how much we value the lives of those around us. That maybe to a degree you think I'm devoted because I do these different things. I do come to church. I do share my faith. I do read my Bible. I do pray to God. And I'm devoted because I do this. But Jesus didn't just simply do it and viewed it as extra. It was his duty. &gt;&gt; That's right. He took on the role in Isaiah. He called they call the Messiah the suffering servant. &gt;&gt; And so for us, you know, we do it in Jesus's footsteps because we have the same heart as he does. &gt;&gt; We want to value other people's lives above our own. you know, uh, the other, uh, week, a few weeks ago, uh, Wes did a welcome for us, &gt;&gt; and he was sharing how he had such a great time at at Thanksgiving with his family. And he spent time with his sisters, his siblings, his family, his parents, but then he he felt just the longing to come back to Tampa and be around his spiritual family. &gt;&gt; No one asked him to, you know, in fact, everybody's like, \"Yeah, go to church in Miami. It'll be great. But, you know, for him, he's like, \"But I want to be around my brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; you know, and just the other day, uh, I believe Maria was traveling and she came back and it's like, you know what? I have my Bible talk. They meet on Tuesdays, but I want to be around disciples. I'm going to go to the chosen Bible talk.\" &gt;&gt; And it WASN'T EVEN HER DISCUSSION. SHE JUST WANTED TO BE around disciples. &gt;&gt; But that is that is the heart of a disciple right there. is I am around disciples because I want to be around them. &gt;&gt; I love them deeply. &gt;&gt; That I I want to give to them. I love hearing what they have to share in my life. Just talk about what's going on. I just love being around my fellow disciples. You know, Tampa needs disciples that don't just check off boxes &gt;&gt; that whether it comes to your quiet times, praying to God, showing up, whatever it is, we're not doing it to simply check off a box. &gt;&gt; We're not doing it because, oh, I am told TO DO IT. I DON'T WANT TO GET DISCIPLED. Or or we go to the farthest extreme end of am I really a disciple? I I have to go to stay a disciple. We're not doing it to check off boxes. We're doing it because we love people &gt;&gt; and we value their lives more than our own. &gt;&gt; Disciples, non-disciples, friends, family, it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; That was Jesus's hearts. And of course, we want to we're trying to move past the you have to go. I understand that we were trying to move past you have to go and if you don't this that that we want to move past that &gt;&gt; because in reality that's not proven character &gt;&gt; that's not genuine faith that is forced character &gt;&gt; and forced character it assumes the you know visuals of genuine faith but it's forced &gt;&gt; and the idea is that you look like you have conviction but you don't have the heart of someone who has conviction. &gt;&gt; And so you do something without having the right hearts. &gt;&gt; You know, I love the term that God gives his people as a whole in the Old Testament, Israel. The term Israel literally means one who wrestles with God and overcomes. What we have to do is wrestle with God. &gt;&gt; It's not about forcing the proven genuiness of your faith. It's not about checking off the box. It's I am struggling with sharing, with reading my Bible, with praying, and I'm going to get down deep and wrestle with God &gt;&gt; and then overcome. &gt;&gt; And that's what's so powerful about it. It's not just one who wrestles with God and just feels weary all the time. Is one who wrestles with God and overcomes. You know, you what we have to do is we have to pray to God, be humble before advice, and be willing to listen to what the Bible has to say. Why? Just so we can see our own hearts. &gt;&gt; Just to even know what we're struggling with. And that's like half the battle sometimes. Just to what are we even being tested in right now? &gt;&gt; It just feels like attacks on every side. And you're like, \"What should I be working on right now? How's my character growing? I just feel like I'm just like utter garbage. That's how I feel sometimes. &gt;&gt; And I feel like half the battle is just recognizing the test, recognizing what God is trying to challenge in your character. You know, God has given you a gift. And with that gift comes the chance to have genuine faith. It took faith to get here. &gt;&gt; It'll take genuine faith to make it till the end. proven faith to make it to the end. And this is important because having no faith doesn't mean you don't get tested. People endure suffering and trials all the time who are not Christians. So it's not that once you become a Christian, that's the only place you'll face suffering. And so if people in the world face suffering, people in God's kingdom face suffering, then what's the difference? What's what's the point in faith? That faith is what makes it genuine. Meaning when you have faith, you actually know what you're going through. &gt;&gt; You recognize the tests. &gt;&gt; So people who don't have faith have no idea why it's happening to them. &gt;&gt; They ask, \"What if God is real? Why is there so much suffering in the world?\" They don't understand the tests, &gt;&gt; you know, and and you meet people like that. I've met people who they say, \"I'm not going to be a Christian because my my family member has passed away of a disease.\" And it's that's half the test recognizing what's God's sovereignty and the trials that we go through. But there's much more. But I think we have to understand that faith is what's going to help you to recognize the test. Identify how God is challenging your character. There's this quote that I read this past week says, \"A slave who does not realize he is in chains will never seek to free himself.\" And this idea of not recognizing the test you're in is is really crucial to lasting till the very end. Because if you don't recognize your test, you won't realize how to grow forward with God, how to progress in your faith, how to have genuine faith. To you is just hardship. Just pure hardship and it's terrible and it's just suffering and it's meaningless. But when you have faith and you can identify your test, you can tell where your chains are. That is where you can seek freedom. And I find this is what we do. This is what we do when we don't recognize our tests. And there's three things I find that we do. We misread what God is doing. We we we see something happening. And this happens, right? People say, \"Well, you know, there's no way I can be a part of this huge movement because I'VE SEEN A HANDFUL OF church leaders who are in sin.\" You misread what God is doing. Have you read the Old Testaments? You know, you have God's people, Israel. Most of those kings were bad. &gt;&gt; Most of those kings were evil. And it took literally decades, centuries until God said, \"All right, you guys are done. You guys are out of here.\" And God is so patient. And you don't recognize what God is doing. You don't recognize God's patience. But that's one example. Uh I find another thing we do when we don't recognize our tests is we misjudge others intentions. You receive discipling, help, encouragement. You know, the encouragement's a little spur there. You know, it's like, \"Oh, that kind of hurt a little bit.\" &gt;&gt; And but you view it as pressure, &gt;&gt; as legalism. &gt;&gt; And someone's like, \"Hey, bro, I think, you know, you're you're really struggling in just, you know, being full of boldness and courage and and you don't even give your heart to singing. You don't you know, I don't really see you trying to help other people. Like, maybe you should just pray. Are you telling me I have to pray? I don't have to do anything. I don't have to read. I just I absorb God's word, you know? And it's like, &gt;&gt; and it's like this this concept of of people trying to help you is always misjudged. &gt;&gt; Their intentions are always twisted in your minds. &gt;&gt; I find the third thing that we do when we can't recognize our tests, it it's because we don't recognize our own drifting away &gt;&gt; and you're you're drawing back. You're taking steps back and to you it's like everyone is doing too much. They're too far ahead. But they're doing what they're supposed to be doing. You've drawn back. &gt;&gt; You've taken steps back. &gt;&gt; But here's the why. Here's the why we don't recognize our tests. I find there's really one of five things. One, our spiritual immaturity makes our discernment weak. And this is interesting because you know it's I saw another graph today where there's like a a pigraph right you have this is how much you know this is how much you know that you don't know kind of like you know I've read Matthew I haven't read Judges but I know it's there right but then if that's how much you know this is how much you know that you don't know everything else is how much you don't know that you do not know. and you don't understand how much vast knowledge and experience people have, but you think that you got it good &gt;&gt; and that your discernment is enough to give other people advice. You know, it's interesting. You know, I'm I'm only five years in the faith and even I'm so careful with what I say. Why? Because I know I don't know it all. And I'm grateful to have brothers like Anthony, Kyle, Chris, Marley, and Jack. these brothers that I know that I can rely on them for knowledge and help. &gt;&gt; I pray that you do too. &gt;&gt; That you're not just relying on your own knowledge and experience. &gt;&gt; You know, the second thing I find of why we don't recognize our tests is our pride and selfdeception blinds our self-examination. And you know, you have quiet times, you have d times, you get mentoring, you hear lessons after lesson on Sunday, midweek, Bible talk, devos, whatever it is. And you're like, you know what? This this is really good for someone I know. &gt;&gt; I know. I know just the person. &gt;&gt; In fact, I'm going to take notes for them &gt;&gt; cuz because they're not here today. So, I'm going to take notes and give it to them when I see it. &gt;&gt; And and you you have to put your own mask on first. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's so important that we have to have daily examination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But pride is what can blind you from that. &gt;&gt; The third thing is that others convictions feel like pressure or judgments. And this is really all based off of feelings. Feelings are what keep us from recognizing God's test. Specifically, you feel pressure, but what God is trying to do is refine you. It's like pressure is not good. You know, there is one person that we're studying the Bible with and you know, he and uh his girlfriend, they were sleeping together and we're like, \"Hey, these are the scriptures. We just want to help you. Shouldn't be doing that. That's not biblical.\" And he was confused. He's like, \"Well, the church I go to, they don't they think it's they they understand that we all have our struggles.\" And in fact, the church he was going to, they're about to make him a children's ministry leader &gt;&gt; and he was going to be leading their children in spirituality for their congregation. &gt;&gt; And he was so confused and like what like he's considering like his accolades in his current church and was like, \"Why are you telling me I can't do this? Why are you telling me if I can't be a Christian if I'm doing this?\" So he went back, talked to his pastor, and he sent me, you know, the the infamous breakup text, and he found a scripture saying that God is not a God of confusion. And he's like, \"Since God is not a God of confusion, and you're making me confused, this is not the place that teaches true doctrine.\" And I was like, \"What? Like, where did that come from?\" &gt;&gt; But it's all it's ALL FEELINGS. IT'S LITERALLY ALL FEELINGS. It's like and and we can experience that here. It's like, \"Oh, you're you're telling me this, you're telling me that.\" I don't like people refining me. &gt;&gt; But if iron sharpens iron, you know, you know what actually makes the sharpening happen? It's heat and pressure. &gt;&gt; And if you're not feeling the heat, you're not feeling the pressure. And that's not good. &gt;&gt; And if you are, that's a good thing. But don't go based off of your feelings &gt;&gt; and view it as judgments. The fourth thing I find that we do is that we believe that backsliding is sudden and obvious, but in reality it's subtle and it's gradual. &gt;&gt; And we fail to recognize our own backsliding &gt;&gt; because we have this belief that if it happens to us, we'll immediately know. We'll just know that we're falling away. WE'LL JUST KNOW THAT WE'RE DRAWING BACK IN OUR FAITH BECAUSE IT'LL BE SO OBVIOUS. But that's a trick from Satan. Like he's trying to get you to realize that you're going to be so far back. He's trying to get you to be so far back. You don't know how you got there where you feel faithless and going forward where you have to give up. You cannot give into that lie. And the last thing I find that we do is we believe lies that appeal to comfort or control. And these are two pretty far extremes, right? very similar to the story of the person who thought I was confusing him that you know we we believe in things that make us feel better about ourselves and you know anyone that's trying to help you get strong you might even have scriptures to prove why you're right even though your faith is weak but the other end I find is maybe a bit more common is we believe in lies that that appeal to our sense of control in the way of well, I'm praying to God. I'm praying to God that, you know, maybe if you're single that you can get married and maybe even praying for a specific date. And then all of a sudden, if that doesn't happen, you're like, \"God's against me. God doesn't want me to prosper.\" But it's true. People feel this. And but no, but this is real. This is real because what happens is you believe that God's uh sovereignty is not with me. that that God does that maybe I'm doing something wrong and you believe all these different things instead of recognizing the tests that way. This is all in God's timing. &gt;&gt; I'm not in control here. &gt;&gt; It's all about God. &gt;&gt; Here's how you fix that. Go to Psalm 139. &gt;&gt; The solution is in the Psalms. Psalm 139 in verse 23 it says, \"Search me, God, and know my hearts. Test me and know my concerns. See if there is any offensive way in me. &gt;&gt; Lead me in the everlasting way.\" &gt;&gt; You know, this is a psalm and psalms are songs. It says in the beginning that this is directed for the choir. But all these songs have meaning. This is worship. &gt;&gt; But I believe that we should also be praying on these psalms. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to ask you guys, how is your worship of God? &gt;&gt; How is your prayer &gt;&gt; in the morning when you wake up? How is your prayer when times are really good? How is your prayer when you feel like nothing is going your way? Do you plead with God to constantly search your hearts and reveal to you any offense, anything that you are doing that might be offensive to him or offensive to other people that you can recognize it, that you can just see the tests, that you can see the chains that are trying to hold you down. I find if we're not praying on God to reveal to us the test that he's trying to refine our faith with is because we're taking his gift for granted. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And we believe I have ETERNAL LIFE. I can never do anything wrong because there's nothing I could do. And he did all the work. And so therefore, I can't do any bad work. I can't do any good work. There's nothing I could do. But maybe the test was just so you could pray in the first place. You know, you were thinking, \"God, reveal to me, reveal to this.\" And maybe you're you're still trying to gain control, but you have to humble yourself in prayer. &gt;&gt; Just go to God that he can reveal your hearts. And then recognize if if it's brought up to you when you're reading, when someone gives you advice, don't keep up that wall of pride. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; But recognize what God is trying to do in your life. You know, we've been given an incredible gift. &gt;&gt; One that causes us to do foolish things in the eyes of the world. You know, we give probably about eight to nine hours of our time, not including traveling to each other. People is like, \"No, I go to work and I go home.\" That's the American way. But we have our lives and our we give our lives to each other. &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, we have a gift. One that can refine you to be holy as the creator of all things is holy. And one that fills our hearts, strengthens our minds, and builds our courage. And there is no other gift that is worth giving our efforts, giving our time, even giving our possessions. And this is the greatest gift that we could ever have. And everyone on planet earth at some point will all bow down to the greatest giftgiver of all time. &gt;&gt; And so as we reflect on the season, as we reflect on, you know, giving to each other, let us remember the great gift that we've been given and let us not squander it. And to God be all the glory.",

    "summary": "This sermon, \"The Gift Above All Gifts,\" celebrates Jesus's birth as the ushering in of the greatest gift: eternal life, which is granted through genuine faith. The speaker emphasizes that true faith is proven through trials and suffering, likening this process to being baptized by fire, which God uses to refine character. It challenges passive Christianity, urging disciples to actively wrestle with God, value others, and engage in humble self-examination through prayer to discern God's refining tests and overcome spiritual drifting.",

    "transcript": "in mind. We're going to look at the at the life of Paul &gt;&gt; because Jesus is amazing, but Paul was really went through a lot of things that from a human point of view that Jesus did not go through even though Jesus carried all our sins. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, let's go and to First Corinthians chapter 15. &gt;&gt; Are you guys with me here? &gt;&gt; All right. We we're little little Bible study here. &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians 15, the book of First Corinthians was written about 53 to 55 AD. So, Paul says these words, inspired by God, of course, in 1 Corinthians 15 in verse 9. You guys there? Let's go there. 1 Corinthians 15:9. Look what he says. He says this. For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them. Yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. So Paul here is saying that look at the way he looks at himself. He says I am the least of all the apostles. Who are the apostles? You know who the who the apostles were, right? The 12. &gt;&gt; And and you know the list of the apostles is even greater than the 12. And here Paul is saying I am the least of all the apostles of all the leaders basically be- because I don't even deserve to be be called a Christian and because of that I worked very very hard. Amen. He saw himself as the least of all the leaders the least of all the apostles. Then Paul gets a little older and then we go to the book of Ephesians. Let's go there. &gt;&gt; Ephesians was written about 60- 62 AD about five years after the book of 1 Corinthians. And in in uh in Ephesians chapter 3, look how Paul refers to himself here. There's an evolution in his view of himself. So in Ephesians 3, uh let's go there. You guys there? Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh let's start reading in verse 7. Look what he says here. Says, \"I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.\" And look at verse eight. Although I am less than the least of all of God's people, this grace was given me to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, and to make plain to everyone the administration of his mystery, which for ages past has been kept hidden in God, who created all things. &gt;&gt; Did you catch it there in verse 88? I am the least of of all of the Lord's people. So here he sees himself different &gt;&gt; than in first Corinthians 15. 1 Corinthians 15 he was the least of the leaders. Here he says I am the least of all the saints. I am the least in the church. I am the least of all the Christians. So as he got older, look at the humility. He grew in his humility &gt;&gt; as he got older. He goes, \"Right now, I am not the least of the leaders. I am the least of all the disciples of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I am the least of all the Christians.\" And then he keeps evolving the way he views himself. And now we're going to go to the book of First Timothy chap chapter 1. Let's go there. &gt;&gt; 1 Timothy was written around 62 to 64 AD. So about 2 to four years after Ephesians. And here he's older. He's an older Christian. And look what he says here in First Timothy chapter 1 in verse 15, which is a scripture that a lot of us know, but I'm going to read it again. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says in First Timothy 1:15, \"Here's a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance. Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I will show mercy, so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example of those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. So here, Paul's older. He's no longer the least of all of God's people. He's no longer the least of all the Christians. Now, what is he? He's the worst of all sinners. So, Paul is saying this, I am the worst of all the sinners in humankind. Out of all humans on the planet, I am the worst of sinners. Now, from a logical point of view, that doesn't make a lot of sense because as you become a Christian, you become more righteous, don't you not? &gt;&gt; Like when you become a disciple, you stop the sins of the flesh, hopefully. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I mean, you you stop the immorality, right? &gt;&gt; You stop the drunkenness, right? &gt;&gt; You stop lying. Uh you you even though you can struggle with it, you you stop the the sins of the flesh, right? &gt;&gt; So, from a certain POINT OF VIEW, PAUL was a lot more righteous. Now then he when he was a young Christian when he was a young yes because he used to even if if you understand the Bible correctly he used to approve the death of Christians. &gt;&gt; He used to imprison them and perhaps he killed them even himself. So this was Paul but he says he's more of a sinner now that he wasn't killing Christians than before when he was. &gt;&gt; How does that make any sense? And what does it have TO DO WITH STAYING FAITHFUL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? YOU'RE CONFUSING ME, RAUL. WHAT WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? &gt;&gt; WELL, it this is a mystery that I'm going to try to explain because it really is is one of the keys to staying faithful for the rest OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; PAUL SAW himself as the worst of all sinners even though he was at his most righteous state at that point. He was righteous at that point. He was suffering persecution for Jesus Christ. He was in prison for Jesus Christ. He was preaching the word. He was doing everything that a Christian would do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yet, he saw himself as worse of a sinner. &gt;&gt; Why? I think a clue is in Luke 12. Let's go there. &gt;&gt; Luke 12. &gt;&gt; In Luke 12, we're going to read a passage that is very interesting passage in verse 47. Luke 12:47. Look what it says here. It says, \"The servant who knows the master's will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who does not know uh and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with a few blows. From everyone who has gi been given much, much will be demanded. And from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. So here is an interesting scripture that we often use in terms of someone should be a leader because if God has given you much talent, right? Uh God demands much from you, right? That's not what what the B that even though that may be true in principle, that's not what it's teaching contextually. What is teaching here is about knowledge of God. He says the the servant who knows the master's will, who knows the Bible, right? &gt;&gt; And he knows the Bible, the master's will, God is the master, and does not obey it will be beaten with many blows. But the servant who doesn't know the Bible yet doesn't obey it will be beaten with less blows. See, knowledge of the master is is the basis of judgment. &gt;&gt; So for example, we understand this from a human point of view in the US US judicial system. If someone commits a commits a crime under 18, uh there's there's a lot of leniency on that person. Why? Because that person doesn't know much about life. That person, even though he did something wrong, he's foolish. He's young, you know, and let's give him a chance, you know? We call that a juvenile, right? Now, if you commit the same crime when you're 30 years old, that's a lot different. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? So you as you have knowledge of life, &gt;&gt; as you have knowledge of of of living in this world, even the US judicial system judges you more harshly. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That is the same with God. Paul was able to say, \"I am the worst of sinners.\" Even though he was super righteous. Why was he able to say that? Because it was true. He was the worst of sinners at that point. The more you know about God, the more judgment is going to come upon you. &gt;&gt; Well, then you say, \"Well, and then I'd rather not know about God at all, so there's no judgment upon me.\" &gt;&gt; Well, no, no, no. That's not the way it works. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's like saying, \"I'm not going to grow up. I'm going to stay 17 the rest of my life.\" No. You know, biologically, you're going to age. You know, &gt;&gt; you're going to age. And and with age comes responsibility. Paul could say, \"I am the worst of sinners.\" Why? Because he was. He was. In what sense? He had more knowledge. Like, I've been a Christian 29 years. &gt;&gt; I read the Bible every year. But my first year as a Christian, I didn't read it. So, I I read the Bible 28 years uh completely from, you know, from end to end. I read the Bible my first year, but I didn't finish the whole Bible in that year. So, I read the Bible 28 times in my life. Plus, I read it once as a non-Christian. So, it's 29 times. Uh, so I I read a lot. I have a lot of knowledge of God. I have a lot of knowledge of the Bible. &gt;&gt; That does not make me righteous. &gt;&gt; What makes me righteous is obeying the Bible. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; So, so I say that all to say this. The older you get as a as a Christian, the more judgment is upon you. &gt;&gt; But that's where the grace of God comes in. As you get old, you understand like we like Linda shared in the communion, it's all about Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, a lot of us what happens, we get older as Christians and we think we're better &gt;&gt; and and and and we think we deserve more. &gt;&gt; But really, Paul just knew, YOU KNOW WHAT? I I I am the worst of sinners because because for Paul, having a lustful thought was worse than immorality in the world because he had more knowledge. See, the more you know about God, the more judgment for you to lie now as a Christian is huge compared when you didn't lie when you lied when you were not a Christian. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; For you to get angry now &gt;&gt; a a as a disciple at your wife or your husband. That's a lot worse than when you weren't a Christian or when you were a young Christian &gt;&gt; because you have more knowledge of the truth. In other words, as you get older, you need more grace. The only thing that keeps you saved is God's grace. &gt;&gt; That's it. The older you get, the more grace you need. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But but people fall from God because as they get get older, we become like Pharisees. We think we're more righteous &gt;&gt; and we think we're better than other people &gt;&gt; because we don't have the sins of the flesh of other people. I don't struggle with immoral sexual immorality anymore. I don't drink anymore. I'm better than that person. Uh yeah, but what if you were in their shoes? What if you had the same life you they had? You probably would have been even worse. So therefore, this scripture applies. Let's go to Luke 18. Let's go there. &gt;&gt; This is what happens to a lot of us as we get older. We fall into Luke 18 verse 10. It says, well, verse 9, Luke 18:9, it says, \"To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable. Two men went up to the temple to pray. One a Pharisee, the other a tax collector. The Pharisees stood by himself and prayed, \"God, I thank you that I am not like other people, robbers, evildoers, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and I gave a tenth of all I get. But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven but beat his breast and said, \"God, have mercy on me a sinner. I tell you that this man rather than the other went home justified before God. For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted. This is my temptation as an older Christian. And it could be your temptation. Older Christian could be one year in the faith. You you're not struggling with the sins of the world anymore. That's what I'm saying. This could be a temptation as we get older in Christ. I am better than other people. I don't curse anymore. I don't curse anymore. I don't uh I'm not cheating on my wife. I'm not adulterous. I'm not watching pornography. Uh I'm better than other people. But you're not &gt;&gt; because you know more about God. So it in in a way you're worse. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; You cannot be justified by your righteousness. &gt;&gt; We're saved simply by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we need to work our salvation with fear and trembling. Amen. But but but it is a grace of God that saves us. And as we get older, we think we think we we deserve more. I deserve more uh time. I deserve more honor. I deserve more this and that. We don't deserve anything. &gt;&gt; You get in a car accident and die today. &gt;&gt; Like we don't deserve anything. So one of the things that helps me to to keep up your heart or I'm trying to Amen. is to understand that hey I am I am worse of a sinner now. Now when else than 30 years ago even though I am a lot more righteous from a from the world's point of view does that make sense? &gt;&gt; And I have an apparent righteousness that said the heart God sees the heart. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; So so that's that's very important &gt;&gt; for us to have this concept in mind. Now when you were the worst of sinners when you know you're the worst of sinners then you can really grow as a Christian. uh because you're only sustained by God's grace &gt;&gt; and and you fear being prideful because you know that that it comes the pride comes before the fall. &gt;&gt; So I want to look at three points quickly here on uh on what happens when you have this mindset. What happens when you understand that you're the worst of sinners? When you understand you're the worst of sinners. Point number one, you have great love. &gt;&gt; Look at look in Luke 7. I'm gonna say in Luke's I decided to just say Luke. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Luke 7, we're going to read a little thing here in verse 36. &gt;&gt; You guys with me? &gt;&gt; Luke 7:36. &gt;&gt; When you have when you know you're the worst of sinners, point number one, you have great love. Look in verse Luke 7:36. When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisees house and reclined at the table. A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisees house. So she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood behind him uh behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on on them. When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \"Is this man a if this man were a prophet, HE WOULD KNOW WHO IS TOUCHING HIM AND WHAT KIND OF WOMAN SHE IS, THAT SHE IS a sinner.\" You see it here? Here we have this woman that um that lived a sinful life, probably was a prostitute. A and she she was so broken because of her sin that she got her most valuable possession, an expensive jar of perfume, and she pou it on Jesus's feet and she cried on his feet and and wet his his feet with his with and dried it with her own hair. She did something incredible to Jesus. And the Pharisee that invited Jesus to eat said, \"This man is a if he were a prophet, she would know that she's a sinner because I am so righteous as a Pharisee.\" Now, the Pharisee was probably not a in prostitution or anything like that. He was probably faithful to his wife. Let's keep reading here. Verse 40. Jesus answered him, \"Simon, I have something to tell you.\" \"Teacher, tell me, teacher,\" he said. Two people owed money to a certain money lender. One owed him 500 to the other 50. Neither of them had the money to pay him back. So he forgave the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more? Simon replied, I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven. You have judged correctly, Jesus said. Then he turned towards the woman and said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I came into your house, you did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman from the time I entered has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not pour oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven, as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.\" Then Jesus said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" The other guests began to say to themselves, \"Who is this who even forgives sins?\" Jesus said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.\" &gt;&gt; So this is amazing. This this woman gave everything to Jesus. She knew she had no salvation outside of Jesus. This woman knows I am fried if judgment day comes. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to hell if judgment day comes. I need Jesus. &gt;&gt; So she she kissed Jesus's feet, wiped them with with their tears, her hair, the alabaster jar of perfume. But the Pharisees like I am righteous. I don't even need Jesus that much. Is Is he really the Messiah? &gt;&gt; I mean, he did all these miracles, but is he really righteous if he's able to, you know, just have this woman touch his feet? Does that make sense? And then the key is here. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little. If you have been forgiven much, you love much. If you have been forgiven little, you love little. What does that mean? &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much sins you have. It's the perception of of how much you've been forgiven. &gt;&gt; If you believe you have been forgiven a lot, then you love a lot. &gt;&gt; If you think you have BEEN FORGIVEN LITTLE, THEN YOU love little. &gt;&gt; But what I mean by love is love in action. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; I'm not saying theoretical love like I love you. No, no, no. is actually doing deeds because of your love. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; Whoever has been forgiven much loves much in action. Loves in action much. And whoever has been forgiven little what loves little in action. &gt;&gt; So when you know you're the worst of sinners, you love in action much. &gt;&gt; And that is the theme that we have for the movement in 2026. The theme of the movement for 2026 is love in action. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh and we're basing that theme on first Corinthians 13 4-8. We want to be a movement of churches of love, &gt;&gt; but but not love theoretic theoretically, love in action. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; So when you know you're the worst of sinners, yeah, you you love much. If you're not loving much in action, it's because perhaps you don't believe you've been forgiven much. &gt;&gt; When you your your actions show your love. Now, that's point number one. Point number two, and we're going to read this here in Luke 19. We're in Luke. We're just staying in Luke the whole time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe we are. In Luke 19, uh we know the parable of the 10 minus, which is similar to the parable of the talents. And we know that two of the guys went and invested their talents and made a lot more and God was very pleased with them. But there was one that hid his mina, which is an amount of money. And we're going to read about that now. Amen. &gt;&gt; You guys with me here? All right. Verse 20. So Luke 19:20 says, \"THEN ANOTHER SERVANT CAME AND SAID, \"SIR, here's your mina, an amount of money. I have kept it and laid it away in a piece of cloth. I was afraid of you because you're a hard man. You take out what you did not put and reap what you did not sow.\" His master replied, \"I will judge you by your words, own words, you wicked servant. You knew did did you that I am a hard man taking out what did not put in and reaping what I did not sow. Why then didn't you put my money on deposit so that when I came back I could have collected it with interest. Then he said to those standing by take his mina away from him and given to the one who has 10 mas. Sir, they said but he already has 10. He replied, \"I tell you that to everyone who has more will be given. But as to the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away. But those enemies of mines who did not want to want me to be king over them, bring them here and kill them in front of me.\" Wow. Not a Hollywood ending right there. &gt;&gt; So, so here we have the one who hid the money, right? And God calls him, you know, the father a wicked servant. He says, \"If you really knew I was a hard man,\" which, you know, I'm all judging by your words. Why didn't you invest the money? Just put it in the bank and you would have gotten like interest, but you did nothing. You had great excuses. So, what is the point number two? When you know when you know that you're a great sinner or the worst of sinners, you can have great excuses. See, the it all depends. There's two personality types usually in the church. &gt;&gt; There are those are are deceived, those that that think they're more righteous when they're not. You know, &gt;&gt; that that's that's my personality type. I can get deceived. Uh but there are those that are accused that are guilty all the time. And and this person was was he knew he was a sinner. He knew he was he was wrong. But he decided to do nothing. He decided just to become a victim. So when you know you are a the worst of sinners in the church, you can you can actually have great excuses and do nothing. Well, I'm a sinner. Might as well just, you know, it's never gonna get better. I'm never gonna overcome. Have you ever been there? I'm never gonna overcome. is always going to be the same. My life is difficult. Uh why why am I in this situation? And you think everything is unfair. YOU THINK GOD is unfair. YOU THINK GOD, WHY GOD, WHY DID YOU GIVE ME THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO INVEST? LIKE YOU'RE A HARD MAN. Like and you think God is unfair. My life is so difficult. My life is so hard. Yes, I'm a sinner. Yes, I'm I'm not worth anything. I'm just gonna do nothing. Have great excuses. And that's very dangerous. &gt;&gt; See, when when you know your worst of sinners, to me, it encourages me. I go, \"Wow.\" Amen. Like, I have hope. You know, but but but but the other half goes, \"You know what? That s is the most depressing thing I've ever heard. I am the worst of sinners.\" Like, because I already know I'm a sitter. I already know that I am horrible. You know, but that's not going to change you unless you have action. Amen. That's not going to change you unless you have action. &gt;&gt; And you could become like this third servant who did absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; This third servant just Yeah, just I'm just going to be in the church and do the very minimum. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come I'm going to go to Bible talk. Um I'm gonna sing a little bit, but don't ASK ME TO DO ANYTHING MORE. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; don't ask me to do anything more. And that's very dangerous, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And people like that also end up not staying faithful. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; When you become a Pharisee, you end up falling away from the Lord either in the church or outside of the church. But when you're think you're just such a horrible person that then and and then just I'm I'm just such a victim victim victim. Then you also end up leaving the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, but you got to understand your value before God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God thinks you're awesome. That's right. &gt;&gt; God thinks you're incredible. &gt;&gt; God thinks you are the most amazing thing ever. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus Christ died for you on the cross. &gt;&gt; Uh he loves you. He wants you to not feel guilty all the time. &gt;&gt; He wants you to have a healthy self-esteem like the world says. &gt;&gt; You can do that with Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so it's so important that we work, if this is you, it's so important that we work on our our identity. like I am awesome in God's eyes. &gt;&gt; You got to think of yourself this way. You got to think of yourself like God not only loves me, God likes me. &gt;&gt; Like when God looks at me from heaven, he goes, \"You know what, bro? Oh yeah, he's a sinner. I want to discipline him here and there, but I love my son.\" &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, I love him. I I I'm pleased with him. That's how you got to think of yourself before the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us don't think of ourselves before God that way, you know, and I know sometimes, you know, uh your father figure there or lack of it or or abusive father figure prevents you from thinking that way. That said, we need to overcome that and understand that God is our perfect father in heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is a perfect father in heaven. &gt;&gt; So yes, when you are the worst of sinners, you can have great excuses, &gt;&gt; but let's not have great excuses. Let's have a great relationship with God. Let's work on our identity and God will be glorified. Amen. &gt;&gt; On point number three, when you're the worst of sinners, you have great faith. &gt;&gt; And look at Luke 7, and we'll finish with Luke 7. You have great faith. We're going to look at a man who had great faith. Uh verse one Luke 7:1 it says when Jesus finished saying all this the peop to the people who were listening he entered capernium there a centurion servant whom his master valued highly was sick and about to die. The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders to the Jews to him asking him to come and heal his servant. When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him. This man deserves to have you do this because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue. So Jesus went with them. So let's explain here for a minute what's happening here. The Bible talks about this centatorum, this Roman general, soldier, captain that was not a Jew. He was not part of God's people at that at that point. Yet, he heard of Jesus. He heard of the miracles. He heard of what Jesus had done healing people. So, he knew Jesus was from God even though he wasn't a follower of Jesus. So, but this was he was a good man. He built the synagogue of the Jews and uh which which is awesome. He built synagogues for the Jews and and and he begged the the Jew the others of the Jews send send for Jesus so he can heal my servant. My servant is sick. I want him healed. So the the the Jews went to Jesus and say come please heal this centtorium u uh servant because this man deserves he deserves it. He's a good man. He deserves for you to do this. And he was in charge. Centurum comes from the word 100. He was in charge of about a hundred soldiers, Roman soldiers. Ain't that great? &gt;&gt; So Jesus goes with them to go heal the centurion servants. And let's see what happens on the way here in verse six. It says, \"So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him, \"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and my servant will be healed.\" So look, look at this for a minute. He his conscience is pricricked by sending the elders of the Jews to come heal his servant. So he sends friends to Jesus. He doesn't even And he tells them, you know what, Jesus, just don't don't come. Don't come anymore because I I am a sinful man. Look at this. He knew he was very sinful. I am a sinful man. I do not deserve to have you under my roof. Wouldn't you like to have Jesus over for dinner? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be great? &gt;&gt; Not this man. &gt;&gt; This man saw himself as such a sinner. He goes, \"You know what? I don't even want to have you for dinner, Jesus. I am such a sinner that I don't deserve for you to come under my roof. I don't deserve it. But I have great faith. And look at his great faith. Let's read here. He says this uh verse seven. Well, yeah. Let's read seven again. That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. BUT SAY THE word and my servant will be healed. For I am a man under authority with soldiers under me. I tell this one, \"Go,\" and he goes. And I tell that one, \"Come.\" And he comes. And I say to the servant, \"Do this.\" And he does it. When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. And turning to the crowd following him, he said, \"I tell you, I have not found such great faith even among in Israel.\" Then he then the man who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant. Well, &gt;&gt; this is an amazing faith. This man says, \"Yeah, I don't deserve you to come be with me. I don't deserve to have dinner with you, but just say the word from a distance. Just say the word from a distance and and my servant will be healed because I have authority over my soldiers and you have authority over the world. So for you, it's not even hard. It's not hard for me to say to one of my soldiers, \"Hey soldier, go and cut some wood, you know, and bring it back.\" Or to say to another soldier, \"Go and uh go to the well and get a couple liters of water for us.\" That's easy for me to say, \"I have authority.\" And if they don't do it, they suffer the consequences. &gt;&gt; But you have, Jesus, you have all authority on planet Earth. &gt;&gt; Just say the word from a distance. I don't even have to meet you and my servant will be healed. And that is what happened. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was amazed at his faith. He goes, \"This guy has more more faith than all my disciples. &gt;&gt; This guy has more faith than all of God's people on the planet.\" &gt;&gt; That's like saying, \"This non-Christian has more faith right now &gt;&gt; than than than all the disciples in the world.\" &gt;&gt; That that can happen. actually &gt;&gt; doesn't mean they're saved, but you can have faith and not be saved. So, but but the whole point here is that when you know you're the worst of sinners, if you understand that correctly, you have great faith &gt;&gt; because you know Jesus is the only thing that can save you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The older you get as a Christian, yeah, you have a lot more wisdom. I have a lot of wisdom. And I say that in humility because I've been a Christian for such a long time. I know the Bible a lot more right now than before, but that doesn't save me. &gt;&gt; The cross of Jesus saves me. &gt;&gt; And therefore, when you are a great sinner, when you understand you're the worst of sinners, you have great faith and you want God to do great things. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what we are as a movement of churches and family churches. We believe that God is going to do great things in 2026. Amen. Um &gt;&gt; see 2025 God blessed us as a collective movement of churches five churches were planted in 2025. &gt;&gt; So two in Latin America uh Bellow Orisi Brazil was planted. Amen. &gt;&gt; And also Montter Mexico was planted. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Dallas, Texas was officially planted in 2025. Amen. But also Yamasuko Ivory Coast in Africa was planted. Amen. We planted that church. and and then also uh Moscat Oman in the Middle East and Middle East nation was planted this year by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was awesome. But next year we have a great dream to plant many churches all over the world. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a few of them. Some in the States, some abroad. &gt;&gt; So these are some of the churches. These are the churches that we're going to plant by faith in 2026 because when you know you're a great sinner, you have great faith. So the first one we're going to plant is Ptoria, South Africa in January. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we're going to go to Rome, Italy. &gt;&gt; Then back TO THE MOTHER MOTHERLAND, ABUJA, NIGERIA. &gt;&gt; Then back in IVORY COAST, BUAKI IVORY COAST. &gt;&gt; Two in England, Manchester and Essex, England. Amen. to Latin America. Asunion Paraguay and Medin Colombia then Toronto, Canada, HOSIM CITY, VIETNAM in Vietnam. &gt;&gt; Two in the Middle East, UH, AMAN, JORDAN AND DOHA QATAR. AMEN. And finally, four in the United States of America. Amen. &gt;&gt; Baltimore, Maryland. Omuhammed, Nebraska, Iowa City, Iowa, and Sou Falls, South Dakota. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's 16 churches. Amen. &gt;&gt; By faith, by your special contributions. You see, when you give your SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION, YOU'RE NOT GIVING IT TO THE LOCAL CHURCH HERE. YOU'RE GIVING IT so that these churches can be planted. And that and that the churches that we already have planted, we have we have hund hundreds of in the states we have we have 130 churches and the churches that we already have planted could sustain their efforts. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to encourage you when you are a great sinner you have great faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you understand that you also have great love. &gt;&gt; So how DO WE STAY FAITHFUL for the rest of our lives? Well, I think in here in the study today, you've seen a little bit of how to do it. &gt;&gt; As you get older, you you get more sinful. So therefore, that protects you from being a Pharisee. Amen. &gt;&gt; And most people that fall away in leadership are those who who are their leading, but they have a secret sinful life. &gt;&gt; But it eventually always comes out. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, so we in leadership and in the church, we need to stay righteous before our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But you can also go to the other extreme and say, \"I'm just such a sinner. I'm not worth anything that that you also fall because you have a low view of yourself. &gt;&gt; God wants you to have a high view of yourself. &gt;&gt; You're very special in God's eyes.\" Amen. &gt;&gt; So, church in Tampa, Florida, I love you. I'm grateful to be here. Let's have a great 2026 and to God be the glory.",

    "summary": "The sermon \"Staying Faithful Forever\" by Raul Moreno explores how growing in humility and recognizing oneself as the \"worst of sinners\"—even as a mature Christian—is crucial for lifelong faithfulness. It contrasts Paul's evolving self-perception with Jesus's parables, showing that greater knowledge of God implies greater accountability, thus deepening one's reliance on God's grace. This humble perspective fosters profound love for God, expressed through \"love in action,\" and cultivates great faith, avoiding both self-righteousness and victimhood. Ultimately, staying faithful means embracing one's value in God's eyes while constantly acknowledging the need for His grace, which empowers us to do great things.",

        "verse": "1 Corinthians 15:9-10",
        "insight": "The speaker introduces Paul's initial humility, where Paul considered himself 'the least of the apostles' due to his past persecution of the church. However, Paul also acknowledges that his current state and hard work are purely 'by the grace of God,' setting a foundation for understanding his evolving self-perception."
      },
      {
        "verse": "Ephesians 3:7-9",
        "insight": "This passage demonstrates an evolution in Paul's humility, where he now sees himself as 'less than the least of all of God's people.' The sermon emphasizes that as Paul grew older, his view shifted from being the least among leaders to the least among all believers, highlighting his deepening self-awareness and humility."

      {
        "verse": "1 Timothy 1:15-16",
        "insight": "Here, Paul declares himself the 'worst of sinners,' which the sermon explains is paradoxical yet profound. The speaker teaches that Paul, despite being outwardly more righteous, recognized his greater accountability due to his extensive knowledge of God, thereby making his internal sins appear worse to him than his former blatant acts as a non-believer."
      },
      {
        "verse": "Luke 12:47-48",
        "insight": "This scripture is used to explain *why* Paul saw himself as the worst of sinners. The sermon states that knowing the Master's will (God's word) brings greater judgment; therefore, the more knowledge a Christian gains, the more is expected, and the more keenly they perceive their own shortcomings against God's perfect standard."

      {
        "verse": "Luke 7:36-50",
        "insight": "The parable of the sinful woman and the Pharisee illustrates that 'whoever has been forgiven little loves little.' The speaker applies this by teaching that an awareness of one's deep sinfulness and the immense forgiveness received from God leads to a profound 'love in action,' distinguishing true devotion from self-righteousness."

    "book_reference": null,
    "series_number": 9,
    "transcript": "We are going to cover the book of John. You know, we finished our Hebrews series. We literally covered every verse of the book of Hebrews. &gt;&gt; We read it all together. And the book of John is great, but it's a lot there's a lot more words and verses in the book of Hebrews. So, we we can't do it like we did last time. We've written first. So actually Mark, Matthew, Luke, and then John. And uh the book of John has no parables. There's not a single parable in the book of John. They they are what uh most uh theological commentators say are allegorories. So a parable, right? Let's take for example the parable of the sewer. It'll talk about the farmer. There's the seed. There's the soil. And if Jesus ever gave the meaning of each of those things, he would say it privately to his disciples. But an allegoryly stated and he'll say who exactly he is in the example. Take for example, I am the good shepherd. I am the door versus there once was a farmer or there once was, you know, a field, right? And so there it's very different. He'll explicitly say the meaning and the intention of his example. So that being considered, there's not a single parable in the book of John. Not even one. And uh also there are only seven miracles in the book of John. Only seven. And we're going to look at it in a sec, but John's intention for the book was that people may believe. And he saw it fit that for people to have a complete belief in Jesus, all they would need to hear are seven miracles. &gt;&gt; And right alongside that, there are seven I am statements. So, same thing that he saw it fit that you only need to hear Jesus claim to be this the seven great I ams to understand that he is God. You only need seven of them. And let's go to John chapter 20. Look at the theme for this book. John 20 in verse in verse 30 it says Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not written in this book but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah the son of God and that by believing you may have life in his name. See, compared to really any other book in the Bible, this book, this letter written by John has the most clear statement of purpose. It is so that those who read it may believe. And I'm actually very interesting in her communion that a lot of the theme of uh the book of Ephesians directed to the church in Ephesus is love. And John actually likely wrote this book while he was in Ephesus. &gt;&gt; So this concept of God's love is portrayed throughout this book. And many commentators say that the original intended audience of this book was the church in Ephesus. &gt;&gt; Uh and but this right it says the clearest purpose here is that we may believe one and two have life in his name. And that is the title for us today. Believe and have life. &gt;&gt; And it's so easy to think of this BOOK AS THAT'S GREAT. Every non-believer needs to hear this book. But it's for us as well. We have to ask ourselves as disciples, do we truly believe without an ounce of a doubt that Jesus is the son of God? And we may know that right now. We're gathered here amongst our fellow friends, family, people who we know are at LEAST TRYING OUR BEST. BUT HOW IS IT WHEN CHURCH IS OVER? &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE OUT BY YOURSELF, AT YOUR JOB, AROUND your family, IN YOUR CLASSES, ALL THESE THINGS, DO YOU still hold that same belief without a shadow of a doubt? And I think this has to be the most important fact in our lives that the world is lost and the world needs a savior and that savior is Jesus. And the second thing outside of do you believe is having life in his name. And life outside of his name without his name. It is the same thing as dying even though you haven't yet met yours. You know, we walk around this earth. There's people around us constantly. They post all these great photos on Instagram. Their life looks great. They you look at their possessions and and maybe even in your heart, you you envy it a little bit, &gt;&gt; but they're dead. They're dead already &gt;&gt; before they've met their ends. You know, most people around us feel hopeless, aimless, they're sinful, they're shameful, and then they walk around without an answer. And it is up to the faithful few to have and pass on the answer that they're looking for. You know, do you believe that you have that answer? I find that in times of great trial, great distress, great sorrow, great pain, as a disciple of Jesus, you question if you have that answer. You you we talk about sharing our faith, but sometimes you ask, \"Do I have enough faith to share? Do I really believe in what I am doing, let alone tell it and preach it to someone else?\" Talk to someone else about it. You know your life and those around you will not change unless you fully believe that Jesus is the answer. &gt;&gt; You have to fully believe this. Point number one is Jesus is the words of God. Jesus is the words of God. In John 1 now, John chapter one in verse one it says, \"In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. He was with God. In the beginning all things were created through him and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. In him was life and that life was the light of men. That light shines in the darkness and yet the darkness did not overcome it.\" You know, it says that the word was with God and the word was God. And then it says he was with God. And so this word is with God and it also was God much like our words today. You know, we speak and there's no physical form for our words. But everything I say is a part of me, but at the same time, it leaves me. It leaves me so that all can hear it. It is the same thing about who this he is, right? And it says that God's word is personified. It became a person. It solidified. It went from something invisible, unseen, but h having full of life just like our breath and it became physical. It became Jesus Christ. And it's important to know that Jesus wasn't a creation. Things were created through him. And there are people that even in the umbrella of Christianity that if you view Jesus as a creation that is considered a heresy because he wasn't created by God. He was God and life was created through him. He was God's word. And so God created he spoke everything into existence. And his words that gave life to the universe to all mankind. It is those words that became Jesus as we know him. And God's word, it lives today, right? You know, he challenges us in our most selfish desires because, you know, his word is a he. He challenges us. He exposes us to our absolute core, &gt;&gt; who we really are. What do we struggle with? And and he fills us with awe and wonder. And if you think about it, that is exactly how those around Jesus felt. Challenged, exposed, filled with awe and wonder. But since his word lives today, it is still the same today. Even though he's gone into heaven, &gt;&gt; so where is his word? But it's right here. &gt;&gt; It's the Bible. It is God's word. And so we all talk about having a relationship with Jesus, but how is your relationship with the Bible? How is your relationship with God's word? You know, I find that there are really four kinds of relationships that are what we're trying to avoid, but people can have and we even we can have in our walks with God. We can have a familial relationship where it's family based, but it's not really you don't have a connection based off of your personal choice. It's based off of inheritance. You know, people say that I was born a Christian. You know, I'm a Christian because my family is a Christian, my physical family. And so, you associate yourself with Jesus and you actually have feelings for him, but it's not based off of personal action, choosing to have a relationship with him. I I saw this video even that this woman was was full of sorrow, full of pain because everyone in her immediate family has passed and it was just her. However, she found news through I believe ancestry.com or something like that where her brother who passed actually had another son. And so when she met him, she was full of joy, full of excitement, full of praise. She was crying her eyes out. But if you think about it, so fascinating because he technically is no different than a stranger. The only difference the the only thing that's the same is the blood in their veins. And I that could be really how our relationship is with Jesus. He's no different than a stranger, but we love him emotionally because we tie ourselves to him by inheritance. But really, you don't know him. &gt;&gt; You don't understand him. You never really met him. &gt;&gt; But you but you have this familial bonds, but it's not based off of experience with him, actually knowing who he is. You know, I found another relationship we could have with the Bible is a professional relationship. And a professional relationship is quite simple. It's all about production. Why is it all about production? is because you want your check at the end of the work week. &gt;&gt; AND SO YOU TELL YOURSELF, \"THE MORE I PRODUCE, THE BIGGER CHECK THAT I MIGHT HAVE. LET ME PUT IN OVERTIME. LET ME PUT IN MORE WORK. GOD, GIVE ME A BIGGER CHECK, A BIGGER INHERITANCE, MORE BLESSINGS.\" But that's not our relationship with the Bible. That's not how we should view obedience to God's word. What's another relationship we could have? The third one is a communal relationship. you do what the community does around you. &gt;&gt; I share my faith because everyone else in my Bible talk does or maybe even you're struggling with sharing your faith because everyone ELSE IN YOUR BIBLE talk is struggling with this and you just do what other people around you are doing. I read my Bible because that seems to be the norm in this church. So, I'm going to read my Bible. You know, I want to get up, pray, come to meetings of the body. It just seems like I see the same people here, so I might as well keep doing it. But it's not out of a personal decision. &gt;&gt; And you're only really doing it because others are doing it around you. I If I could speak boldly for a moment here, &gt;&gt; I don't think we're any of those. I don't think I think maybe some of us might be in one of those three categories of our relationship with the Bible. But I would say as a church what we're struggling with is the fourth one that I haven't mentioned yet. But we view the Bible as our caregiver. And what do I mean by as our caregiver? There is dependence. There is relying on God's word with it which is good. But having a caregiver is you're in the state where you cannot get better, where you do not get better. And so there's dependence, reliance, which is good, but there is no growth and there is no maturity, which is bad. And you know, we I I like to think of, you know, we have Anna, you know, people we've been around kids. You know, if you're like Jesus, you should like being around kids, right? They're they're awesome. They're cute. And so Anna Anna is great, our daughter. And you know, there's a time when I'm so grateful right now she's being potty trained and it's great because there's less diapers you have to change, &gt;&gt; but it's still hard work trying to train trying to train her. But overall, you think of, you know, what kids go through. You know, they have stinky diapers. You know, they make messes. And, you know, even the other day, Anna had marker like all on her hands. And I was like, Anna, there's markers on. There's drawing on your hands. And she was like, \"Oh, she's like, \"Daddy.\" And it was like she didn't even notice. Like, she didn't even notice that her hands were mostly a different color. Um, but it's just funny. That's what your kids do. They're just aloof, you know, just happy golucky and it's awesome. But, hey, man, there's a time for that. No one's mad at Anna for doing for being a kid. But she can't stay that way. She can't be that way for long. You know, think of even today maybe people in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and so on. And they have the right tools to get better. They have the Bible, but they're not growing. They're not changing. They're not transforming. And I I find what happens is that becomes our reality in our walks with God when we're so fixated on problem solving. &gt;&gt; We're so fixated on on solving issues in our lives. You know, we think we look at the Bible and we view our quiet times like, \"All right, what are my issues and what are my solutions?\" But the issue is with that is that once you if you're so fixated on problem solving once you fix one solution you just go on to the next not one solution the next problem. And so it's kind of like you're in quicksand you know your foot is sinking. So you finally get one foot out of the quicksand like great one foot's out it's on top of the sand. Now I got to pull the other one up. But as you're pulling the other one up THE OTHER ONE IS GOING DOWN. And so you're really just stomping in place, treging in the same spot, thinking you're making progress because your legs are worn out, but you're still not moving forward. That's what happens when you have a caregiving relationship. And I find we get so fixated on our problems because we're not forward thinking. &gt;&gt; We're not thinking about what is ahead of us. You know, God is not our great problem solver. You know, the book of John is so powerful because it has Jesus's longest recorded conversation. So, a a lot of the book of John is different different than the other gospels because Jesus is having discussions with the people around him compared to just simply preaching or simply miracles or parables. There's a lot of discourse discussions in the book of John. And if you go through it, think about it. if there's any issues, any problems h that are in front of Jesus, you know, the paralytics on the mat, whether it be people who need healing. And the longest conversation being with the Samaritan woman who had gone through different marriages, different husbands, and he's never like, \"Oh, that is so terrible, man. I guess that's a big problem.\" Like, he never dwells on the problem. He's always focused on him. the lights. Why? Because it's about the direction, not about where you're coming from. And I find what we happen to forget as disciples is that we are actually made in God's image as good. Let's go to Genesis chapter 1. There's a lot of parables between Genesis and John, especially about this concept of, you know, creation. And you see the parallel in the beginning of Genesis versus the beginning of John. And the book of John, a lot of it focuses on uh not just Genesis, but the whole first five books, it even compares some of Jesus's miracles to Moses's miracles. But in Genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 says, \"Then God said, let us make man in our image, according to our likeness. They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock the whole earth, and the creatures that crawl on the earth. So God created man in his own image. He created him in the image of God. He created them male and female. God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every creature that crawls on the earth.\" And then it says in verse 31, God saw all that he had made and it was very good indeed. You know when God created, you know, the lights, he created the earth, he created the expanse, he created all the things, HE SAID IT WAS GOOD. And when he created mankind, Adam and Eve, he says it was very good. You know, every time I preach on this concept of being like Jesus, I get at least one person who comes up to me and says, \"No, no, NO. WE CAN NEVER BE LIKE JESUS. THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE. But in this passage, God when he created us, he said we were good. But then we think of Jesus, he says, well to the man who called me good teacher, he says, well why do you call me good? Only God is good. Which is a true statements because we think of Romans 3 which says no one is righteous, not even one. Is because on our own we want to give into sin. We do give into sin. WE ARE ONLY RIGHTEOUS NOT BY OUR OWN ACTIONS but by what Jesus has done for us. &gt;&gt; So you can be like Jesus. We can be good as God created us to be. But what happens is we get so fixated on our problems because we don't think that's possible. &gt;&gt; We think no no I'm only bad. I can only do what is bad. I'm not capable of doing good. And I don't know about you, but I struggle a lot with repeating negative thoughts in my minds. And it loops and it loops and it loops. And I'm praying. I'm trying to write it down. And I'm like, can I just think ONE POSITIVE THOUGHTS, but all that is once again my sinful nature. I I need Jesus. &gt;&gt; I need to be forward thinking and not think about the past behind us. &gt;&gt; How do I know that God created us to be good? In Genesis 1, what did he created us to do? Yes, to multiply, but it said to rule. &gt;&gt; God created us to rule. To rule all the birds of the sky, all the fish of the sea, every creature that is on the earth. And what happens is I find, you know, in in modern culture, we've really adopted this concept of introverted, extroverted, which I don't think is wrong in and of itself. You know, people are more inclined to sit back, get energy, and then come forward versus some people, they just love being around people. But we've taken that so far to believe that only some people are dreamers. &gt;&gt; Only some people think big. &gt;&gt; Only some people want good things, great things in their life. &gt;&gt; But that is actually false. We are all, each and every single one of us created to rule, &gt;&gt; created to do great things. And maybe you think, \"No, no, I'M I'M ONLY A SMALL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE.\" BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T DO GREAT THINGS. &gt;&gt; God created each of us to rule. But when you're so fixated on your problems, you forget that. &gt;&gt; You don't believe that. In fact, you get, like I was saying, you get trapped in the negative thoughts of, \"No, no, I'm I'm created and I'm bad. I can't do good. I cannot be good.\" That that is a lie from Satan. God created you to do and to be good. You know, if we consider every time we fumble, every blunder, every injustice, each sorrow, in each pain-filled moment, I those could be reasons that you might want to stop, not want to move forward. And like I saying, you get nourishment, you have your quiet times, and you feel good for a moment, but you're not getting healthy. You're not getting strong. So yes, we need healing, nourishment and guidance from the word of God. But the effect of that must be maturity. It must be good health &gt;&gt; and it must be growth and life in Christ. If you keep reading in verse 10, it says he was in the world and the world was created through him and yet the world uh John 1 10 and yet the world did not recognize him. He came to his own and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God. To those who believe in his name, who were born not of natural descent or of the will of flesh or of the will of man, but of God. The word became flesh and dwelt among us. He we observed his glory, the glory as the one and only son from the father full of grace and truth. You know, it said Jesus came to his own creation. He He came to earth, but those who were all created through him didn't even recognize him. They didn't see him. And it's so easy to say, \"Yeah, they didn't recognize him.\" But, you know, if I was there, I would have been amongst those that knew him. I I could HAVE I COULD TELL from the miracles from the first one, I would have known. In fact, I would have been a follower of John. I would have known without even seeing him. &gt;&gt; And it's it's so easy to and I and there's times you're like, how could they not? Like what? Like you how could you not like five loaves, five fish, and then 5,000 people? What? Like how could you not do that? And you know, you could think that you could be amongst those who become children of God, but those who became children of God recognized him. They recognize specifically that they were created through him. Do you recognize who you were created through today? &gt;&gt; You might believe so strongly that you would have been amongst those that believe in him, but think of all the times that you doubt, well, am I really made to be like Jesus? Am I really capable of being like Jesus? Why? Because once again, we were created through him. He he we are his creation. He's we are designed to be like Jesus. And I love the rest of this passage how the word became flesh and it dwelt among us. And even now the word is alive and active. Jesus has gone into heaven seat at the right hand of God. But his word, God's word is still alive today. It still roams the earth this earth. And if you go to verse 29, &gt;&gt; it says before we before it talks about Jesus, it talks about John. And John, he was sent ahead of Jesus to prepare the way as we know. But what that literally meant was that he would amass followers. He would point to Jesus and then they would follow him. And let's see that dynamic happen in verse 29. It says, \"The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, 'Look, the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. This is the one I told you about. After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he existed before me. I didn't know him, but I came baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel.\" And John testified, \"I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and he rested on him. I didn't know him. But he who sent me to baptize with water told me, \"The one you see the spirit descending on and resting on, he is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. I have sent and testified that this is the son of God.\" The next day, John was standing with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the lamb of God.\" The two disciples heard him say this and followed Jesus. When Jesus turned and noticed them following him, he asked them, \"What are you looking for?\" They said to him, \"Rabbi,\" which means, \"teer, where are you staying?\" \"Come and you'll see,\" he replied. So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about 4 in the afternoon. Point number one is, \"What are you looking for?\" &gt;&gt; What are you looking for? And I find this significance because a lot of the other gospels, it starts off with Jesus preaching. But this gospel starts off with, like I said, John points to Jesus saying, \"That's the lamb of God.\" And the lamb of God is significant because the lamb in the Old Testament was the sin offering. you have an an un an unbellished and you know perfect young lamb and when you committed a sin you would go to the temple you would place your hand on the lamb and then it would get sacrificed and the concept was that your sins were on this perfect being and so now Jesus is the new perfect sacrifice the new perfect being that takes on the sin of the world and so John said look that is him that is the messiah that is now here. And so his followers would go then go to him and then when they were following him, it was kind of like just they didn't even approach him and talk to him first. They kind of just followed behind him. And Jesus had to be the first one to kind of notice them. So, you know, like what are you looking for? And it's an interesting statement because Jesus knows he he knows what's in the heart of man. And we'll even read that later, but but he knows what's in the heart of man. He knows what's in people's minds, but he wanted to hear it from them. What are they looking for? And I want you guys to ask yourself that question today. What are we looking for today? What are you hoping to see in your relationship with Jesus? You know, I find that sometimes for those of us, even if you've been around a few months, a few years, or many years, many decades, you know, we have to ask oursel the same question. What are we looking for? Because the reason why we started this journey may not be the same reason why you're still here today. You know, go to first John chapter 4, also by John, the same author, but different. 1 John chapter 4 in verse 17 it says in this love is made complete with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment because as he is so also are we in this world. There is no fear in love. Instead perfect love drives out fear because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears is not complete in love. We love because he first loved us. You know, this passage is so powerful because what's happening here is maybe you guys can relate, but like me, I started studying the Bible when I was young because I feared going to hell. I feared punishments. And I thought to myself, you know, I believe in God, so I believe heaven and hell exist. I don't think I want to go to the ladder. doesn't sound like a place I want to be &gt;&gt; which I think is a fair argument and that might maybe for you as well have started your journey being at least being curious about God it's like you know what let's just look into this Bible let's see if I even have what it takes to do what it says and that's how you start off and THAT'S OKAY THAT'S WHAT GOT you here but you cannot stay that way &gt;&gt; you cannot not stay here. &gt;&gt; And even with me, that's how I started. I didn't want to go to hell and it was great. And then I fell away a year later &gt;&gt; because that stayed my reasoning. &gt;&gt; My reasoning was fear of punishments. &gt;&gt; And fear of punishment is different than fear of God. Fear of God is recognizing God's power. &gt;&gt; AND GOD'S POWER ISN'T JUST SENDING YOU TO HELL IF YOU DISOBEY HIM. &gt;&gt; He has much greater powers than that. &gt;&gt; That's right. much more fulfilling powers than that. But maybe you get focused on just the consequences of disobedience. But instead, not even focusing on the fear of God versus the fear of punishment, but you're focusing on God's love. You're focusing on the love of Christ. &gt;&gt; And the fear of punishment and the love of God can sometimes look very similar in how you run your race, in how you're living your disciplehip. The difference is, do you view your walk with God as running away from your sin or running towards God? Is it are you focused on what's behind you or what's ahead of you? And you're still running, but there's a difference because if you're looking behind you, we have to look unswervingly. You swerve, you know, when you're driving, but you have to look. I was actually surprised when we were living in Miami. There's a brother that I was in the car with, young brother, and we're just driving. I'm in the passenger seat, and I'm like, \"Bro, you're you're not checking your blind spots.\" &gt;&gt; It wasn't Mario. Uh, &gt;&gt; he might do it, but it wasn't him. But, but I'm like I'm like, \"You're not checking your blind spots.\" And he's like, \"Oh, sorry. You know, I should have checked my I need to do that more often.\" And about five minute, hear this. About 5 minutes later, he's like, \"Bro, I'm so sorry. I lied. Where are blind spots?\" I was like, \"Wait, wait, what?\" &gt;&gt; And so, and so there's a there's another brother who uh his job is um he works on helping people renew their licenses. And I asked him, I'm like, \"Bro, do in the the Miami drivers test, do they test for checking your blind spots?\" He's like, \"No, they don't.\" I was like, \"What?\" &gt;&gt; So, yeah, in Miami, they don't test you if you check your blind spots. And I'm lucky we got to our destination safely. Amen. But, you know, you you check your blind spots and you want to do this. WHAT WHAT happens if you check your blind spots? &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? LIKE &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO CHECK YOUR BLIND SPOTS, BUT YOU CAN'T FOCUS ON YOUR BLIND SPOTS. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE INTO SIN, BUT YOU'RE NOT SO FOCUSED ON YOUR WALK WITH GOD LIKE YOU'RE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS. &gt;&gt; That's not the point of your walk with God. You're looking forward. You're looking ahead. There is no fear of punishment. It's all about love of God. Are you focused on the darkness you're running from or the light that's ahead of you? &gt;&gt; And uh it's literally don't look behind you, look ahead of you. That's the practical. Don't look behind you, look ahead of you. Let's go back to John. And I I think it's very similar the saying that we know and we hear a lot that many people want a savior, but how many are willing to make him Lord? &gt;&gt; And those people who just want a savior, they're only looking behind them. But when Jesus is the Lord of your life and you're thinking about, well, I want to be just like him, you're looking ahead of you. you you're realizing about God created me to be good. Yes, I have fallen but all I'm thinking about is what's ahead becoming the lights that is that is within me. You know as disciples we must be thinking about what is ahead of us and we cannot get stuck in the past. That is where Satan wants us to be. Focused on the darkness, running, but looking back enough to where we start swerving off the narrow road. That is the goal of Satan. And it's time for us to start thinking ABOUT TAMPA'S FUTURE AS WELL, &gt;&gt; you know, and I can even get caught up, you know, like, you know, Tampa, I wonder what it was like in the past, you know, all these different things. I wonder if people were more open to the gospel back then. All this different stuff. But you know, let me not dwell on that. What could Tampa be because my life is changing? &gt;&gt; WHAT COULD TAMPA BE? BECAUSE YOUR LIFE IS CHANGING AND YOU'RE FOCUSED ON JESUS SO MUCH SO THAT IT INSPIRES others to do the exact same. &gt;&gt; Cuz everyone else is focused on their past. Everyone else is focused on their problems. But we're not like that. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; We're focused on the light that is ahead of us. &gt;&gt; Let's close out in First John. Not first. I'm sorry. John chapter one. &gt;&gt; John chapter 1 in verse 43 says, \"The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philillip and told him, \"Follow me.\" Now, Philillip was from Betheda, the hometown of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathaniel, and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law.\" And so did the prophets. Jesus, the son of Joseph from Nazareth, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Nathaniel asked him, \"Come and see. Come and see,\" Philip answered. Then Jesus saw Nathaniel coming toward him and said about him, \"Here truly is an Israelites in whom there is no deceit.\" \"How do you know me?\" Nathaniel asked. Before Philip called you, \"When you are under the fig tree, I saw you.\" Jesus answered, \"Rabbi,\" Nathaniel replied, \"you are the son of God. You are the king of Israel.\" Jesus responded to him, \"Do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.\" Then he said, \"Truly I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" You know, this passage that we'll close out with here is so powerful because these men follow Jesus. And I believe that John wrote his gospel in this way where there is no Galilean ministry before his Judeian ministry, highlighting how you can follow Jesus without you having to know everything about him. You just have to believe. And a while ago, we did this sermon on entering the cycle and how, you know, maybe you're thinking, you know what, for me to believe, I have to have knowledge about him first. You know, for me to have knowledge about him first and I have to believe in him first if I want to start something. And really what happens is you can get so caught up in what to do, how do we enter THE CYCLE, HOW CAN I BECOME A FOLLOWER OF Jesus that you end up not entering at all. You get so stuck. But you know what's important here is that you can believe without this thorough knowledge of the word of God. All you have to do is believe once again as John stated that Jesus is the one that takes away your sins. And when you know that wait a minute I could have redemption, I can rebuild my life. I can be born again. I can change. And it's not about just religious rituals. It's not about avoiding darkness or avoiding pain, avoiding sorrow, doing this that and the third to look right. I can actually have my life changed. That is where you start to follow Jesus. And you know, we can't get caught up on the fact of I need more knowledge for me to believe. No, you need to have more faith to have more knowledge. &gt;&gt; You know, and then here, you know, what was the first thing that Philip did? He got Nathaniel. And that's so important for as disciples. Like, wow, I believe in him SO MUCH THAT I DON'T EVEN NEED TO SEE WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO NEXT for me to bring my friends along. You know, I find that sometimes we have a hard time sharing our faith because we're too concerned about our future as disciples. But when you're not focused on problem solving and you're focused on, you know what, a life in his name is the best life I could ever have &gt;&gt; and I fully believe in that. You want to grab someone with you as well. &gt;&gt; And I love it, right? Because you know it literally flips it. I John is so specific in how he did this. So instead of being so fixated on what do I know about Jesus, it's the opposite that's true. Jesus knows everything about you and that's all it takes because he knows everything about you. You're like, \"Okay, I can follow this man. I can believe in him.\" You know, back to what I was saying, how's your relationship with the Bible? When you read the Bible and you're seeing all of yourself, all of your sins exposed and how much you need to change, you're like, \"Okay, I need to put my faith in this.\" you know, when you have your quiet times, are you self-reflecting or are you reading just to read? &gt;&gt; You know, it's important. You know, I asked these questions in the lessons that we have, but and even Chris, you know, does a teaching today, Kyle did a teaching last week, but the idea is that you want to actually reflect on who you are according to the word. &gt;&gt; Do you reflect the word? And you know the last thing it talks about is how Jesus says truly I tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the son of man. And the chapter closes out with Jesus focusing on himself as the son of man and that he his origin is literally from heaven. That he is not like anyone else. And the son of man we talked about it it's in Ezekiel. It talks about in Isaiah and many of the prophets that Jesus, who he is, is more than just a simple human being. He has power. And when you recognize this power that he could have in your life, it'll cause great things in your life as well. So really ask yourself today, you know, am I focused on my past, focused on the darkness, focused on walking on eggshells, fear of punishment, or am I looking ahead to the great things that Jesus can do in my life? Am I thinking about what will I do to the city around me because of the power that dwells within me? Yeah, I think it's time for us as a church to not be focused on the darkness or on God solving all of our problems, but be focused on what will we do once our lives are changed. Let us believe in his name and have life to the full. To God be all the glory.",

      {
        "verse": "John 20:30-31",
        "insight": "The speaker identifies this passage as the clearest statement of purpose in the entire Bible: John wrote his gospel so that readers would believe Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and by believing, gain life in His name. This foundational purpose sets the theme for the entire sermon."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 1:1-5",
        "insight": "This passage introduces Jesus as the 'Word' who was with God and was God, emphasizing His divine pre-existence and role in creation. The speaker highlights that Jesus was not created, but was the invisible Word of God personified, bringing life and light that darkness cannot overcome."
      },
      {
        "verse": "Genesis 1:26-31",
        "insight": "The sermon uses this passage to counter negative self-perception, explaining that humanity was created in God's image, declared 'very good,' and given the mandate to rule. It reinforces that people are inherently capable of goodness and great things as God intended, urging a shift from problem-solving to forward-thinking about their God-given purpose."

      {
        "verse": "1 John 4:17-19",
        "insight": "This passage is used to distinguish between a fear of punishment and a genuine love for God, stating that 'perfect love drives out fear.' The speaker challenges listeners to move beyond merely avoiding hell to running towards God, motivated by His love, which transforms their discipleship from fear-based obedience to a proactive pursuit of God's will."
      },
      {
        "verse": "John 1:43-51",
        "insight": "The account of Philip and Nathanael illustrates that belief in Jesus doesn't require exhaustive knowledge, only a willingness to 'come and see.' The speaker emphasizes that Jesus's profound knowledge of an individual is sufficient for them to place their faith in Him, encouraging disciples to share their faith even when they don't have all the answers about the future."

    "transcript": "They came out of Egypt, you know, they built the tabernacle. Moses gave them laws and there were people that were given certain rules for who were uh who was in charge of all of the tabernacle and the later temple their duties. And in the family of Levites, there was a specific family that was in charge of doing all of the singing. &gt;&gt; And and as you hear sometimes, if you're there early enough for service, you hear Noah do his thing saying, \"Levites.\" &gt;&gt; That's what they say. It's cuz it's it's biblical. It's in it's in the Bible. And in 1 Chronicles chapter 9, we have the Korites. The Korites were the specific singers of the tribe of Levi. And it says in verse 33, the singers, the heads of the Levite families stayed in the temple chambers and were exempt from the other task because they were on duty day and night. Okay, so literally out of all the Levites, some were in charge of moving all this stuff, in charge of burning the incense. They were in charge of placing the candle here, the table here, and all that stuff. But there was one specific family of the Levites where they just stood there touching nothing. And they just sang. And they just sang. And they just sang. And it's amazing because what how often did it say they sang? It says day and nights. &gt;&gt; That they would just cycle who was singing &gt;&gt; and that they would be there, stand there and sing. THEY'D GET TIRED AND THEN SOMEONE COMES REPLACES THEM AND THEY just keep singing. I want you to imagine you're there and it's night time and there there's no like how it is now. There's no cars honking. There's no planes flying over and you just hear the subtle sound of singing from the temple. &gt;&gt; That's what it was supposed to be like. Just constant singing when all was quiet. At least you can hear singing from the temple. &gt;&gt; So, I hope it encourages you. Maybe we're singing for basically an hour straight. They were doing it 24/7. &gt;&gt; So, I hope it encourages you. Let's go to Psalm chapter 32. There was actually, this is totally a side note, I'm just going to throw this out there. There was actually a movement that happened in around the 1800s to where it they did I I'm pretty sure it was for five years straight. They always had a member praying for five years straight. And so the idea was that like they would they would go there's a certain room they had and they would there was always someone in that room 24/7 for 5 years straight praying and they would just cycle and that's how I imagine how the the Korites did it for singing just year after year second after second just cycling someone in and out that they be always be singing. I thought that'd be kind of cool. Um but in Psalm 32 it says in verse one it says how joyful is the one whose transgressions is forgiven whose sin is covered. How joyful is a person whom the Lord does not charge with iniquity and in whose and in whose spirit is no deceit. When I keep silence my bones became brittle from my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy on me. My strength was drained as in the summer's heat. Then I acknowledge my sin to you and did not conceal my iniquity. I said, \"I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Therefore, let everyone who is faithful pray to you immediately. When great floodwaters come, they will not reach him. You are my hiding place. You protect me from trouble. You surround me with your joyful shouts of deliverance. I will instruct you and show you the way to go with my eye on you. I will give counsel. Do not be like a horse or a mule without understanding that must be controlled with a bit and brittle or else it will not come near you. Many pains come to the wicked. But the one who trusts in the Lord will have faithful love surrounding him. Be glad in the Lord and rejoice you righteous ones. Shout for joy all you upright in hearts. &gt;&gt; You know I I love this scripture and you know when God fills your heart we should be singing. &gt;&gt; And why do we come together? Why do we gather? Why do we sing? Is not because we're told to. Is not because there's some announcement in some community group chat and we do that on Wednesday nights because that's what everyone else around us does. We do it because God forgave us of our sins. &gt;&gt; And singing comes from a grateful heart. And we know the feeling. We know the feeling of, you know, we ask ourselves, God, where are you? God, I want to feel you in my life. Where is your presence? I want to be I don't want to just do your will. I want to be motivated to do your will. I want to do more. I want to be more, but please move me to do so. and really is really asking God, what is what is he going to do in your life? God, move me. But we're forgetting something is that he already forgave us our sins. &gt;&gt; That is all the motivation we need. &gt;&gt; And so when it comes to singing is just like every other form of praise. We do it because he forgave us our sins and we are eternally grateful. There is no extra motivation to sing. There is no, you know, extra incentive. You know, I'll sing once I'm good at it. I'll sing by myself all alone. You know, I I I'll sing once I know the lyrics, once I know the song. Just some sort of shout of joy because God forgave you your sins. That's what he is looking for. There will be even songs that we might sing tonight that aren't even in English. You know when when Matt and I were in India, I have no idea how I was put in charge of this. &gt;&gt; So for this the sages conference, not wait not sages, the SAMC, the South Asians missions conference, I was in charge of the song ministry. So So I want you guys to think about this practically. We're in India. They don't speak English in the other churches. So, I had to come up with the song order for every service, the you know the whether it be the the general sessions, the men's service, the women's service, all that stuff with some English songs, some Hindi songs, and some Tammo songs. And I had to generally know what they were about because I don't want to put a communion tol song for the first song of the general session. So I have to literally know all this information. And so it caused me to deep dive into all of these songs and their lyrics and what do they mean? And they're so powerful. And then I found that even when we were singing them and I didn't and I'm just trying to match make sure I match the right sound, right? matched the right pitch. And I may not know what it was, but hearing every other disciple sing to God, make a joyful noise, it resonated in my hearts that while even though I may not know exactly what the lyrics are saying, I can feel the love of God through the shouts of joy. And so I want you guys to be moved by that. That what we're doing here, why we're singing is out of gratitude for God. And so at times when we hesitate to sing, when we hesitate to give to God, realize maybe it's because of a lack of gratitude, &gt;&gt; a lack of realization for why we're really here. You know, if if God has forgiven you your sins, you should be overflowing with joy. &gt;&gt; You should be overcome with joy. And when you start to look like the man or the woman, the brother, the sister where they come into the fellowship full of sorrow, full of pain, even to the point of unable to sing with joy. Well, what does it say here? It says in verse 10, many pains come to the wicked. And I find the person who is unable to bring themselves to even say just a shout of joy, they start to look a little bit like the wicked. But we're not like the wicked because our sins have been forgiven. &gt;&gt; And we have to always remember that. When when even when you feel pain, you feel sorrow, you feel like no one's noticing you, like God's not noticing you, remember that he did forgive you of your sins &gt;&gt; and you can sing shouts of joy. Let's go to Luke 6. Luke chapter 6 in verse 45 says, \"A good person produces good out of the good stored up in his hearts. An evil person produces evil out of the evil stored up in his hearts. For what? His mouth speaks from his mouth speaks from the overflow of the hearts. That is singing. Is your heart overflowing with gratitude? You know, I find that when we start to draw back in our singing or any form of praise and worship towards God and really our as Noah was saying, you want to sing during your quiet times, but really all of your quiet time is worship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, that's your morning worship. as your first form of worship when you wake up in the day, your quiet time. How how is your morning worship? But I find that when we're struggling in our worship is because we believe that our problems outweigh our blessings. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And yes, God has done great things in our life, but our current problems are more significant than what he's already done. what we're going through, what we're struggling with, the sins we're having trouble overcoming or maybe a torn relationship, the weight of that feels more than the joy that we have from our sins being forgiven. And I find what is what do we have to do when we're in these moments when we're unsure of how to make sure that we look at God and not just look at our problems. We're overflowing with gratitude, not overflowing with criticism towards how things could be better in our lives. is we have to always look at God &gt;&gt; and look at what he has done. Let's go to one last scripture in Psalm 17. &gt;&gt; And I think we have to know this, right? Like maybe if you're struggling singing to God, it's not because maybe you're struggling with hating him. And I find sometimes our minds go to extremes at times. &gt;&gt; It's not because you struggle with hating him, but it's likely just because your mind is somewhere else. you need to bring back your focus to the Lord. And uh in our last scripture here in Psalm 17, it says in verse 14, \"With your hand, Lord, save me from men, from men of the world whose portion is in this life. You fill their beliefs with what you have in store. Their sons are satisfied and they leave their surplus to their children. But I will see your face in righteousness. When I wake, I will be satisfied with your presence. You know, we are not like everyone else. We are not overcome with pain, with sorrows. We are overcome with joy. &gt;&gt; And so when we get together and we sing, IT'S IT'S FINALLY AN OUTLET. YOU KNOW THOSE TIMES when maybe you're in class or you're at work and you're just itching to get back home and just to finally relax. It's the same thing with singing. You you look at your life and you look at all that God has done in your life and I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SING TO GOD. &gt;&gt; That's what it's supposed to be. We're not like everyone else. We're we're not just looking for our our our satisfaction in this life. &gt;&gt; When we sing, we're looking ahead. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there is no problem that could ever outweigh what God has done in our lives &gt;&gt; cuz we're constantly looking ahead. You know, there is nothing that anyone could take from you, that anyone could do to you, that anyone could say to you, or there is no form of harm that could ever happen in your life that could rightfully take the gratitude that you should have &gt;&gt; because God has forgiven you of your sins. You know, everyone else is satisfied with what the world has to offer, but we're not. &gt;&gt; We sing in longing to be with God one day. So, let gratitude fill your hearts for the next few songs that we're going to sing. Let us remember what God has done for us, how he has forgiven our sins, and let us remember who he made us to be. And let's sing to God. And to God be all the glory.",

    "transcript": "We've hit the point in our Hebrews series. It's coming to a close. &gt;&gt; The final chapter, not of our lives, but of the book uh that that we're reading. And I want to take a few minutes to quickly reflect on the journey so far to get to this point in what we've learned, talk about what we've looked at, reflect on it. And remember at the very core of the message, it is that the Christians are undergoing very terrible times in persecution and is leading to many of them already and then some still debating falling away. apostasy and really being a Christian was a was your gambling with your life at that point was whether or not you were going to live if you went outside that day depending on the city where you were living in. And today we talk about temptations and tests. For them it wasn't like a temptation. And it was more than just a test of staying faithful, but it was a a literally practical exam to where if you say the right answer that Jesus is Lord, it'll cost you your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if you say the wrong answer and you don't profess his name under much distress, it'll cost you your soul. &gt;&gt; And they had to come to a decision. And so what more can we talked about? We've covered the depth of Jesus and who he is, especially through the lens of the Old Testament. Looking at everything, we've talked about the promised rest that comes at the end of our Christian walks. We've talked about the danger of falling away. How Jesus is our perfect sacrifice, our perfect priest, and our perfect temple. And because of his his what he did on the cross, he brought us a perfect new covenant ministry. And it led all the way up to Hebrews 11 about saying, \"Wow, we need such great faith.\" And then Hebrews 12 saying, \"With great faith, we need great endurance and the strength in what is weak.\" And with all that, Hebrews, closing out Hebrews 12 last week, I believe Hebrews 13, the message is to press forward. &gt;&gt; When all is said and done, to press forward. You know, the last thing we looked at in last week, Hebrews 12, was how when things get tough, when things get hard, the world has the opposite message. It says to slow down, to take a break. That if something is too hard, that maybe it wasn't meant for you. in the first place that if you were to slow down, reassess and try something different. That's all you need to do. If you want to stay happy, all it means is to avoid discomfort. But that is not the message of Jesus. And that's not the point of this book of this letter. And I find whether times are tough against all hope, you know, when the logical answer answer seems to be to slow down, that the point of the message is to press forward. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; To keep going forward. And even before getting into the lesson, if I could even speak openly is that even this past week, I was feeling hopeless. Specifically, feeling hopeless in my leadership is questioning whether or not I can do all that I need to get done, all that I want to get done while still holding on to hope at the end in the sense of seeing the great picture, the big picture. It's so easy to get caught up in the little things, so easy to take offense to all the problems happening around me. But can I really push through all of that? do what I need to do while still holding on to hope. &gt;&gt; And I found myself struggling with that this past week. And it and if you guys have ever struggled with hopelessness, raise your hand if you've ever felt hopeless before. &gt;&gt; I came to a realization that hopelessness is proof that you want to see great things done in your life. because you can't lose something that you don't have. &gt;&gt; And so even in this question of can I really do it? Am I capable of doing it? Do I really want to do it or are other people pushing me? The simple fact that you feel hopeless is proof that you want to do great things. I believe God has created us to be naturally ambitious for him &gt;&gt; so that he can use us to do great things. That literally Jesus said that among those born of woman, no one is greater than John the Baptist. But then he continues and says the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. that the greatest prophet that closed out the very end of the old covenant, everyone in God's current new covenant ministry is greater than John the Baptists. &gt;&gt; So feeling hopeless is natural cuz it means that God wants us to have hope. And so we're going to talk about today, how do you press forward against all hope? And I find that what it is is that we're we're standing before a wall. A wall where we doubt, we question, we criticize, and really we feel unable to move forward. And what happens is sometimes instead of allowing God's strength to carry us over that wall, cuz that's really what that wall is, you hit a point where your strength cannot get you to move forward any longer, and you need God's strength. that I find what could happen is that you get comfortable with that wall being there and you learn to live with it. Meaning you learn to live in your hopelessness. &gt;&gt; You learn to live of not knowing how to press forward with God's strength. And God is calling each and every one of us not just to have great times with him. reading your Bible, praying, fellowshipping, singing to him, getting getting whatever you need to do by doing all these things that you think is right. But you have to actually get strength from those things. Get strength from your times with God, strength from your times with each other, so that even if maybe you can't climb that wall today, that you get a little higher today than you were yesterday and then a little higher the next day and you keep doing it until you actually get over that wall with God's strength. You know, I really believe that the final chapter of this book of Hebrews, this letter of exhortation, as it says, it wants us to focus on three things for pressing forward. Pressing forward with love, pressing forward with praise, and pressing forward with knowledge. We'll start with point number one, press forward with love. In Hebrews 13 in verse one says, \"Let brotherly love continue. Don't neglect to show hospitality. For by doing this, some have welcomed angels as guests without knowing it. Remember those in prison as though you were in prison with them and the mistreated as though you yourselves were suffering bodily. Marriage is to be honored by all and the marriage bed kept undefiled because God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers. Keep your life free from the love of money. Be satisfied with what you have for he himself has said, \"I will never leave you or abandon you.\" Therefore, we may boldly say, \"The Lord is my helper. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?\" Press forward with love. You know, when you know who the Lord is to you, you know who you must be to others around you. And here, right? Whether it be love between your fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, whether it be love between your spouse, you know, whether love for your wife or love for your husbands or even between your material possessions, just simply being content. You know, we will always display the love of Christ when Christ's love dwells in us. And this is really interesting because in this final letter, it it almost seems, at least for me, and I don't know if any of you guys could relate, it almost seems random that at after everything considered about not falling away, pushing on to the end, running your race. It kind of just throws in there, not really related to other things, have hospitality. And I when I read this, at least for me, I question what does that have to do with anything? When I read the Bible, it's like almost like every verse I kind of read, what does this have to do with anything? Cuz I'm not reading it just verse by verse, but in the context of everything happening. So I read something like this, I'm like, what does showing hospitality and why is it all of a sudden talking about marriage? What does this have to do with anything? &gt;&gt; And I find what happens is going back to the idea that they're struggling with falling away. apostasy is that when you're going through something difficult, these areas are the first things we seem to complain about. Our relationships and our marriages or our material possessions, you know, in your relationships, maybe you're questioning, well, where is this drama coming from? And kind of going back to what Kyle was saying is a lot of the things we struggle with inwardly are our own individual sense. But then what happens is we try to outsource it. We're like, where are my problems coming from? Where are my sins coming from? And amen. If someone anger is not a sin, people can make you feel angry, but when you act out in your anger is because you're typically pointing it to somebody else, &gt;&gt; you know, and let's say your marriage, right? you know, whe whether there's expectations that you have for yourself of how you should be and then when you don't meet those expectations, you feel like a failure and then you take it out on your spouse or vice versa, an expectation that you have for your spouse and you get angry when it's not met. But once again, in both those issues, the issue is you. &gt;&gt; The issue is is ourselves personally. And then of course I think material possessions, it's so easy to think that we're above this one. But when we're going through something difficult, we often try to find a way to ease that discomfort by finding something else to that that can please us. The most typical way we talk about is sin, common sins of the flesh. But it could be other things. It could be other things like diving into uh uh entertainment and you're doom scrolling for hours because it's easier than actually sitting praying and thinking about what you're going through. You know, think of all the times that you've taken out your anger or your sadness or your anxiety and you've brought it to a brother and sister hoping that they can solve the problem, but they can't because only God can. Think about the times that maybe you've, you know, you've vented all your frustration to your spouse, but it wasn't really them. And maybe they said something that it was a straw that broke the camel's back. But in reality, all the other feelings come from something outside of your marriage, but it's brought to them. I I find that, you know, in these times, you know, where we slander because, well, it's it's because they did this. We're gossiping. only because they said this. I have to tell you, you know, I I I can't forgive because they need to say this to me first. &gt;&gt; You know, whether it's if only I had this thing in my life, then it wouldn't have led to this. If I whether I had more money, I wouldn't be so ungrateful. You know, whether I just my if my car was just working, right, that wouldn't be so mad at people asking me where I'm at all the time. you know, all these different things. It really all that is saying here, it all comes back to the author's response to their own apostasy, their own falling away, and that they have to be intentional in their relationships and be content in life. And I find when you're when you believe in this message wholeheartedly, at the very end, it says, \"The Lord is my helper. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?\" It comes from Psalm 118. So, let's go there briefly. &gt;&gt; Psalm 118 and verse 5. This is where the verse comes from says, I called to the Lord in my distress. In distress, the Lord answered me and put me in a spacious place. The Lord is for me. I will not be afraid. What can a mere mortal do to me? The Lord is my helper. Therefore, I will look and triumph on those who hate me. It is better to take refuge in the Lord than the trust in humanity. It is better to take refuge in the Lord than the trusted nobles. All the nations surround me. In the name of the Lord, I destroy them. They surround me. Yes, they surround me. In the name of the Lord, I destroy them. What a powerful passage. And it goes back to this concept. You're in distress. You're surrounded. It seems like there's no way out. How there's no way that you could overcome. Maybe it feels like there's no way you can change. And you take that notion and you destroy it. Those feelings of I can't overcome and you destroy it because God gives you strength. And the ultimate reason why we even do this is because we're trusting in humanity. Whether it be in other people, but I find most typically going back to the wall is we're trusting in our own strength. But that's not what's going to get you to press forward. You know, this all of this that we have here is very important that we press forward with love, especially in times of distress because we all know what it feels like when you have the thoughts of, I don't know if Christ is really with me right now. I feel like I'm not succeeding in what I want to do. I want to share my faith. I'm not making any disciples. And then now because I'm not making disciples, I don't even want to share my faith anymore. And now now I'm not doing the will of God. I just I question my salvation. Right now in these times especially, what we need is brotherly affection. Because when someone can't feel the love from Christ, they need it from you. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. When someone is going through a hard time, unsure of their direction, their future with God, because they're un maybe they're even doubting if he's really there with them, they need it from you to keep pressing forward. So, it's so important that we press forward with love because when your faith is low, when another disciple's faith is low, what they need is your love in that moment. They need your affection. They need to know that you are there for them. That you don't care about having more. That it's not about even simply like doing more. It's about being what someone needs in that moment. &gt;&gt; It's important that we press forward with love. Point number two, press forward with praise. Let's go back to Hebrews 13. Hebrews 13 and verse 7. says, \"Remember your leaders who have spoken God's word to you as you carefully observe the outcome of their lives. Imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Don't be led astray by various kinds of strange teachings. For it is good for the heart to be established by grace and not by food regulations, since those who observe them have not benefited, we have an altar from which those who worship at the tabernacle do not have a right to eat. For the bodies of those whose animals uh of those animals whose blood is brought into the most holy place by the high priest is the sin offering are burned outside the camp. Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate so that he might sanctify the people by his own blood. Let us then go out to him go to him outside the camp bearing his disgrace. We'll stop there. You know we when I read this passage we're going to backtrack a little bit. I want to start with this. We need more leaders if we're going to get the job done. &gt;&gt; We need more leaders if we're going to get the job done. &gt;&gt; For every single single brother in this room, you need to get married. &gt;&gt; You need to be a leader for your households. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay, it's interesting. The the married the married brothers are cheering. The single brothers are silent. &gt;&gt; You need to get married. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's it's important cuz you need to realize that God made you a leader &gt;&gt; and you need to take up that role and do it rather quickly. if the if the Lord permits. Okay, so Natalie and I Natalie and I we I talk about it. We we we dated for 3 months before I proposed to her. &gt;&gt; And then I proposed to her and 3 months later we got married. &gt;&gt; Six six months turnover. &gt;&gt; And it it sounds radical, but that's really how it was like 50 years ago. Yeah, &gt;&gt; like that's how even in Western culture, that's how it was 50 years ago. It's really social media that has rotted our minds honestly. &gt;&gt; But uh you need to get married. Amen. &gt;&gt; For any of the disciples here that aren't discipling anybody, you need to disciple people. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And if you're discipling people, maybe you have the knack for it. Get a co-leader and then have a Bible talk. We need Bible talk leaders &gt;&gt; and then some, not all Bible talk leaders. We need to rise up and be overseers of other Bible talks, &gt;&gt; other small groups. And uh right now the church, we have nine Bible talks. &gt;&gt; The the Tampa Bay area has 3.5 million people. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking this last night. How many Bible talks does it take to evangelize 3.5 million people? We have nine. Let let's say let's say no one desired to be a leader from here on out &gt;&gt; and that and that the point of our leaders meetings was just to get each Bible talk leader capable of leading like hundreds of thousands of people. If if we never grew in our Bible talks, each Bible talk is responsible for about 400,000 people &gt;&gt; to evangelize. &gt;&gt; And then I and let me ask another question. Is Tampa getting any smaller? &gt;&gt; So let's say you split it by person. Let's say there's like seven 10 people in a Bible talk. Let's say roughly each person is responsible for sharing with 50,000 people in their life, but Tampa's not getting any smaller. So, let's say somehow someway you reach that number and then it's like, hey, guess what? Tampa doubled. You got to do it again. Like, &gt;&gt; we need more leaders. &gt;&gt; That's the point of this. And uh in 2026, we're going to start house churches. &gt;&gt; Come on. We're going for house churches. &gt;&gt; And the point uh when we do house churches, we're going to have once a month, end of the month house church services. We're going to have weekly, you know, obviously men's and women's midweeks by house church. And the idea is that we want people to rise up and lead within their communities. And the reality is if we had Bible talks like by each street like you know one block there's a Bible talk another block there's a Bible talk like we need thousands of Bible talks to be quite honest with you and it's not about having just a big stadium that we all meet in but it's not the size of the stadium it's the size of the mission within our hearts &gt;&gt; so even if we meet in smaller groups the zeal is still the same &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; the mission is still the same. The desire to do more is still the same. And so we need everyone here to desire at some form of leading other people. &gt;&gt; And I want you guys to think of it this way. You want to guide others the way that you want to be guided. What what could happen is you love the teachings. You love hearing the advice. Going up to brothers and sisters, getting life advice. It's awesome. But if you don't pass it on, then what's the point? &gt;&gt; You know, let's say you go to, you know, the most fired up people about getting married was the Swans. &gt;&gt; I I I said, \"You guys got to get married.\" And Kyle's like, \"And let's say Kyle and Sam gave you all the advice on what you should do getting married, practical life advice. And let's say he checks in a month, two months, 6 months later, &gt;&gt; and you're not doing any of it. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; do you think Kyle's going to keep giving you advice? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't think so. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't if I was in Kyle's shoes. I'd be like, \"Okay, how about you just do this and like don't ask me another question until you do this.\" Like, that's like how I would form it essentially. And but here's what happens is we want to receive it but we don't want to give it. &gt;&gt; And so those of us, you know, we receive advice to become leaders to give it to other people. &gt;&gt; When you receive life advice, you get married, you go after being a great disciple in your workplace. You become that to show others how to do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if it ends at you, then we're not going to go anywhere. we're not going to get the job done. And I think it's important that we go after doing this. And and let me go a little further in this, right? In verse 12, it talks about how Jesus suffered outside the gate, right? And it's making a comparison between taking an animal sacrifice and how they they sacrificed it inside the camp, but they would actually burn it outside of the camp with outside of the camp, the the tents, right? or the the temple walls. It would be in the city but outside of the temple walls and it's relating Jesus to the sacrifice and how he suffered outside of the camp. And once again, I asked myself this question, what does that have to do with anything? Why does it go from leadership to Jesus suffering outside a camp and talking about burnt offerings? And well, let's think about this for a sec, right? Um, and it even comes after, actually before I say that, it comes after how it says not to be led astray by various kinds of strange teachings in verse 9. And it says, \"And to instead be established, your heart be established by grace and not by food regulations.\" Because if our hearts are not established by grace, then we'll be led to strange teachings. We'll be led to false doctrines. Right? So if your heart is established by grace, you are led to Jesus outside the camp. If your heart is established in regulations, then you are led to false doctrine. You are led to strange teachings. Right? So sometimes we want more rules and regulations in our walks with God, but it'll actually lead you to believing false doctrine. And that what you need is yes to follow Jesus but not out of regulations and restrictions but out of grace. &gt;&gt; And it leads you to follow him outside of the camp. But a heart established in grace, you know, to follow Jesus outside of the camp. What does that mean? What does it mean to follow Jesus outside of the camp? Well, it says specifically in verse 12 that that's where Jesus suffered. He suffered outside of the camp. And so I find going back when we make rules and regulations and restrictions in our walk with God and that's how we believe it's done. What happens is the reason why you do that in the first place is because you want to avoid suffering, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You put rules in your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Not because you think it's better for you, but going back to this whole notion of the less you suffer, the better your life is. &gt;&gt; So why do we make regulations is cuz we don't want to suffer the way Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And what happens is you go from, oh, I shouldn't like that. That's just not really for me to I can't. And then to eventually I won't. And it's okay to have healthy boundaries. You know, God will never give us more than we're capable of overcoming, right? And it's not like, you know, you're in a full-time student, you have a full-time job, and I'm like, \"All right, you got God's got you. Here's 50 people to disciple.\" You know, that's that's not how it works. We have healthy boundaries. &gt;&gt; But what I'm saying is don't let your healthy boundaries become limiting beliefs. &gt;&gt; Wow. And &gt;&gt; what what what will happen is that you know maybe it actually was established in a good heart. I I'm right now that's just not what I can do. But let's go back to Hebrews chapter 5 says by this time you ought to be teachers. This was to everyone reading the letter. And thinking about it, who was reading the letter? Those who wanted to follow away. So it was those who think I can't do it. I'm weak. I can't press forward. He's like, you have to be able to teach others. And so this concept of, you know, passing on, you know, what you learn to the next generation, a heart being established by grace, you know, really all of it is on one topic. It is following Jesus to suffering outside the camp to suffer as Jesus suffered because there's no way we can press forward unless we suffer as he did. And when you actually continue reading, suffering is praise to God. &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading in verse 14. It says, \"For we do not have an enduring city here. Instead, we seek the one to come. Therefore, through him, let us continually offer up to God a sacrifice of praise, that is the fruit of lips that confess his name. Don't neglect to do what is good and to share, for God is pleased with such sacrifices. Obey your leaders and submit to them since they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. So, they can do this with joy and not grief, for that would be unprofitable for you. pray for us for we are convinced that we have a clear conscience wanting to conduct ourselves honorably and everything and I urge you all the more to pray that I may be restored to you very soon. You know this passage it says praise is the fruit right it is the byproduct is the effect of lips that confess his name. The word confess is homo. It literally is the word hama which means uh together and logos which is speech. So literally the word confess it literally means together speech. That's literally it's just two words put together. The word together and the word speech. That's what confessing means. And so to confess in Jesus's name is together speech in Jesus's name. You're bringing people together with your speech in Jesus's name. That's what it means to confess. And so Jesus suffered for what reason? It says in verse 12, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood. And that word might is very powerful here &gt;&gt; because it doesn't mean everybody will be sanctified, &gt;&gt; but he's giving them all the chance to &gt;&gt; to receive his sanctification. And so when Jesus suffered that he might sanctify people, we also go and suffer confessing his name. meaning that is bringing people together with our words for Jesus's sake so that they might be sanctified. And whenever you do that, you're inviting suffering in your life cuz you're opening your hearts. You cannot help others be like Jesus if your heart is closed off. You're opening your heart so that it's vulnerable and that you're willing to take on pain. You know, when you share your faith, that is praise. Because when you suffer for sharing your faith, talking about your testimony and what Christ has done for you, and the reality is some will receive it, but most really won't. You know what Jesus's suffering is like the that he might sanctify people. And this message is, you know, it's it's a hard pill to swallow because you think about suffering and what Jesus did, but the reality is the more you do it, the more you understand his sacrifice. You know, I I really believe that sharing your faith is one of the best medicines that we have as disciples &gt;&gt; because the more we do it, the more we realize like, wow, this is hard. I know what Jesus went through. People are rejecting me, making fun of me, denying me, threatening me. I've been threatened before. And I know what this is like just a even a little bit more. And I understand what Jesus went through. And so, you know, it then it goes into a little suddenly once again, obey your leaders. And it seems kind of abrupt and it says for the reason as to make their lives a joy. be. Why? In light of all this is because they lead based off of how many people they are capable of suffering for. Think of those that disciple you. Think of your Bible talk leader. They they are understanding suffering a little bit more because of how many people they're willing to open their heart to. They're willing to suffer for. And yes, the more you're like Jesus, day by day, you know, we're think, I want to be more like Jesus. I I want to lead more. Well, to lead more means you're going to suffer more. &gt;&gt; And so, you're right. You will lead more, but you will also suffer more. And the path to saving this lost world is paved by those who are willing to do what others won't, and that is to suffer for others. Greater love knows nothing like that. that there is no greater love than suffering and laying your life down for your friends. And so now that we know what what praise is, it is the fruit of confessing his name. Ask yourself, how is your praise this morning? How are you suffering in confessing his name? Are you suffering? Are are you o maybe you're doing the act of sharing your faith but are you opening your heart &gt;&gt; that it may be vulnerable enough to be hers are you suffering you know have you been avoiding suffering have you been trying to avoid suffering by putting up boundaries that you know will become limiting beliefs and you put up all these restrictions why because you want to make that your walk with God cuz you know that you'll suffer if you don't that your heart will be too You know, it's important for us to stop avoiding what Christ is calling us to do. And we need to be like him by suffering for him. And that will bring about the salvation of many people. &gt;&gt; Let's go to our last point. Press forward with knowledge. In verse 20, it says, \"Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead, our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, equip you with everything good to do his will, working in us what is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.\" Brothers and sisters, I urge you to receive this message of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly. Be aware that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon enough, he will be with me when I see you. Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who are from Italy send you greetings. Grace be with you all. You know, and now we we have now read every word of the book of Hebrews together. And and the the the last things it talks about is really a farewell. And it starts off saying how Jesus is the great shepherd because of the everlasting covenant that came through his blood and that God rose him from the dead. And because of that, God gives us every good thing so that we can go after finding our dream careers. &gt;&gt; No. that God gives us every good thing so that we can have a luxurious life on earth. &gt;&gt; Wait, sorry. &gt;&gt; So that we can do his will. &gt;&gt; That is why God gives us every good thing. &gt;&gt; And so the question is, if God gives you everything good, what are you doing with it? You're in a great kingdom. You have great family. You have people that typ people pay hundred hundreds of dollars for having others in their life to give them life advice. &gt;&gt; Like people people literally pay for friends. You guys know that, right? &gt;&gt; And with even AI nowadays, you don't even have to go anywhere. &gt;&gt; It could be on your phone &gt;&gt; and you can like make a prompt to what they're like. Like literally what we have is becoming so so valuable. &gt;&gt; And if we have every good thing, what are we doing with it? &gt;&gt; Are you using it to do God's will? Whether you're married, God gave you a great thing. &gt;&gt; Are you doing God's will with your marriage? God put you in this city, Tampa, and maybe you have a good career. Maybe you don't like your career, but you have a career. or you have a job. &gt;&gt; What are you doing with it? Well, hopefully. Yeah, hopefully. If not, we have people who can give you advice on that, but are you using it to do God's will? Don't misuse it. Doing his will is pleasing to God. And I don't know about you, but I have lived enough of my life trying to please myself. and even into disciplehip falling and pleasing myself when you know and even not even maybe I'm trying I'm living to please other people &gt;&gt; and if pleasing God also means that I have to suffer a little bit to be like Jesus then so be it cuz at least I'm done living my life pleasing myself trying to please people And once again, people may ridicule me, mock me, make fun of me, but that's because they've hit their own wall of hopelessness and they've chosen to live in delusion rather than to be redeemed. &gt;&gt; I think it's important for us to, you know, I've said the word suffering about 100 times already. &gt;&gt; And as disciples, we should get used to it. Like that should be as common as a word as like faith, &gt;&gt; right? And you know, you hear that word and it's like, man, these guys are crazy. Why do they want to suffer like that? Like, who talks about suffering as much as they do? Well, it's because we've chosen the path of redemption, the path of being like Christ, realizing that there's no point in living to please ourselves, but to please God, even if it means suffering. So, what is this knowledge? What is this knowledge that we have that we press forward with? It is knowing who Jesus is. It is knowing, you know, what we're all here to do, what we're all here for is knowing what we're a part of. You know, at the end of this letter, it says, \"Those who are from Italy send you greetings.\" And it's kind of an interesting statement because this letter is I'll say it again. It is to those who are struggling with falling away and to pe to the churches all around. And what h has Italy but the capital of Rome? Rome is of course where the emperor is. So Italy specifically is where the height of persecution is, the height of suffering. And so at the end of this letter is literally saying the church that suffers the most says hi. That's literally the conclusion of the letter all things considered. And guess what? The church that has it worse is saying, \"Hi, they hope you're doing well. They hope you're doing okay.\" And that's the close of this letter. And it's convicting because what it leads us to understand at the end of Hebrews is that we're never alone in our suffering. We're never alone in our trials. We're never alone when we're going through hard times, hopelessness, faithlessness, unsurity of what the future holds. that we are literally never alone. So what does it mean to press forward with knowledge is to press forward knowing that you are never alone in your battles. So press forward with knowledge, press forward with praise, and press forward with love. To God be all the glory.",

The speaker emphasizes three ways to press forward: with love, praise, and knowledge. This includes showing brotherly affection, maintaining marital fidelity, being content, trusting in God, actively suffering for Christ by confessing His name, leading others in discipleship, and using all God's gifts to do His will. The core message is to find strength in God and community, especially when facing trials, recognizing that suffering is an integral part of following Jesus and brings about the salvation of many.",

        "verse": "Hebrews 13:1-6",
        "insight": "The speaker explains that these seemingly disparate instructions (brotherly love, hospitality, marital fidelity, contentment) are crucial for Christians struggling with apostasy. He argues that during difficult times, these are the areas where internal struggles often manifest as complaints. By practicing these forms of love and contentment, believers learn to trust God as their helper, overcoming fear of man and finding strength in Him."

        "verse": "Psalm 118:5-11",
        "insight": "This passage is highlighted as the source for the bold declaration in Hebrews 13:6, emphasizing refuge in the Lord over trust in humanity or personal strength. The speaker uses it to illustrate how, when feeling distressed and surrounded, God provides strength to overcome doubts and feelings of inability, encouraging believers to destroy notions of 'I can't' and instead rely on God's power."

      {
        "verse": "Hebrews 13:7-13",
        "insight": "This section is interpreted as a call to leadership and discipleship, encouraging believers to imitate the faith of their leaders. The speaker connects being led astray by 'strange teachings' to prioritizing regulations over grace, noting that regulations often stem from a desire to avoid suffering. Following Jesus 'outside the camp' means embracing suffering as Christ did, rather than trying to avoid it with self-imposed rules."

      {
        "verse": "Hebrews 13:14-16",
        "insight": "The 'sacrifice of praise' is defined through the Greek word 'homologeo' (together speech), meaning to bring people together with words for Jesus' sake. This act of confessing Christ's name and sharing faith is presented as praise to God, inherently inviting suffering as one opens their heart to vulnerability and potential rejection, thereby deepening their understanding of Christ's sacrifice."
      },
      {
        "verse": "Hebrews 13:20-25",
        "insight": "These concluding verses, including the farewells, reassure believers of God's peace and His role as the 'great shepherd' who equips them with 'everything good' not for personal gain, but 'to do His will.' The speaker emphasizes that this knowledge, coupled with the final greeting from the suffering church in Italy, reinforces that believers are never alone in their struggles and that their purpose is to please God, even through suffering."

    "title": "You Endure For What You Value",
    "speaker": "Malik Speckman",
    "church": "Tampa Bay ICC",
    "book_reference": "Hebrews 12",
    "series_number": 12,
    "transcript": "Let's go to Hebrews chapter 12. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 12. My title for us today is you endure for what you value. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I first wrote that, I said to myself, \"That doesn't sound like an English sentence.\" So, I had to double check it. And it in fact is an English sentence. You endure for what you value. &gt;&gt; And we're going to talk about it, right? &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; What we value will ultimately be what we want to endure trials for. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to ask ourselves throughout today's lesson is what do we value? What do we find worth enduring? In verse one, Hebrews 12, it says, \"Therefore, since we also have such a large cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every hindrance and the sin that so easily ens snares us, let us run with endurance the race that lies before us, keeping our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfector of our faith. For the joy that lay before him, he endured the cross, despising the shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\" We'll pause there for a moment and I WANT US TO REFLECT on what we finished last week's lesson with. the fact that there are so many men, women of God who died in the faith, prophets, prophetesses who died in the faith and all these people now coming off of the end of the chapter are are all now looking at us, &gt;&gt; witnessing us, you know, and then the question is what are we going to do? Will we endure? And of course, the fight is to finish our race faithful, the make it until the very end. But here here's the reality that we won't be able to die in faith the same way all those men and women did in the Old Testament if we're holding on to hindrances. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; If there are there is sin in our life that is constantly ins snaring us. &gt;&gt; Come on. And I want this to be known first and foremost today that God has great things in store for you. &gt;&gt; That God has places where he is trying to take you and he wants to get you to do things that maybe right now you don't believe in. You're unsure if you're really capable of doing it. Or are you really capable of leading others to Christ? &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. capable of maybe mentoring, discipling more people? &gt;&gt; Are you capable of growing in the areas that you've been weak in your entire life? &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Is God really capable of taking you to new heights? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And if you're trying to follow Christ, the message here is you cannot bring with you things that God doesn't want you taking. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hindrances. It's not sin. is not objectively sin, but it's keeping you from finishing your race. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Or of course there's it's falling into traps of sin, right? So now there's hindrances. It's not directly sin, but then there is directly sin and it traps you ON YOUR PATH. It's kind of like you have weights, extra weights. Those are the hindrances. And sin is the traps along the path. &gt;&gt; But the reality is God didn't put either of those things there. You know, you're asking yourself, why is my walk with God? Why is it why is my weight so heavy? Why are there so many traps along the way? And you're asking God, why is my path so difficult? This path you've laid before me. But God is saying, I didn't put that there. You put that there. &gt;&gt; You out of the weights, th those traps that you laid, I didn't put those there. I am light. Nothing can tempt me. That's not by me. &gt;&gt; That is by you. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, we are responsible for our own race's difficulty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus says, \"My yoke is easy and my burden is light.\" So therefore, if we think that our race is difficult, but Jesus says his yoke is easy, then okay. So it's not Jesus making this difficult. It's me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it says that Jesus for the joy that laid before him endured the cross. &gt;&gt; You know when he was beaten, when he was betrayed, when he was tortured and he was bloody naked on a cross, that is objectively challenging. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That that we can consider that objectively hard. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But what did Jesus hold on to that allowed him to push through all of that was the joy that laid before him. And so what made him able to go through all of that was because he knew that it was worth it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when something is worth it, it makes any challenge bearable. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, if you dropped every hindrance, every excuse, every sin that entangles you, the question is, could you still endure the cross? Could you actually make it to the very ends? Because when we carry our cross, there is nothing that we cannot do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, if you find your walk with God challenging, it's what do you have to drop? &gt;&gt; What sins are you still falling into? You know, what are you running for? Why are you running? Is it the ideal American dream that we talked about last week? &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Is the reason why you find Christianity, even living worth it, is because you have this ideal lifestyle that is being pushed onto you simply by materialism, by selfishness, by wanting more. You know, this this lifestyle where everything comes to an happy ending, a happy clothes. Is it to achieve your childhood dreams? Maybe is to support your family that lives abroad. Maybe it's just to have a big house, have a big family, have the dream job. Not all of these are objectively bad, but is that why you're running? &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Is that why you're fighting? Or maybe you're here because you're actually not sure the answer to that question. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why Why am I fighting? Why am I running? In fact, I'm Maybe you're here today to find the answer to that question. &gt;&gt; Well, let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 7. Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes chapter 7. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It says in verse 10, don't say, \"Why were the former days better than these?\" &gt;&gt; Since it is not wise of you to ask this, wisdom is as good as an inheritance and an advantage to those who see the sun. Because wisdom is protection as silver is protection. But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner. Consider the work of God. For who can straighten out what he has made crooked? In the day of prosperity, be joyful. But in the day of adversity, consider God made the one as well as the other, so that no one can discover anything that will come after him. You know, if you think that your best days are behind you, the glory days were a few weeks ago, maybe even this past Thursday when you had the best meal of your life. &gt;&gt; Or maybe you're thinking a bit more spiritually. Maybe you're thinking the best day of your life was when you got baptized. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, the best day of your life is right now. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And God wants you to believe that. &gt;&gt; That's right. And when you're in times of prosperity and things are going great, yes, be joyful. But when times aren't going as good and you can even debate, question your minds. You know, I I don't think today was as good as the days I've had previously. God wants you to stop and consider. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I love what he says to consider that he has made both days, one of prosperity and one of adversity. But it is so that no one can discover anything that will come after him. You know there is so much that lies ahead of us in the future. So much that is in store for us that God says that he has a perfect plan for you. Not not to harm you but the pro the not to harm you or bring disaster on you but to prosper you. &gt;&gt; A plan of hope &gt;&gt; and a future. &gt;&gt; And so we have to believe that the best days are ahead of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. as a disciple. You know, it's easy to think that yes, you know, we're going to be with God in heaven one day, &gt;&gt; but we have to always hold on to that the best days in our life are ahead of us. &gt;&gt; We have to fix our eyes on Jesus, the one who starts and perfects our faith. And no matter what is happening or no matter what has happened to you, we have to always let the joy of Christ uh continue to be ahead of us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The joy of Christ isn't behind you. &gt;&gt; It wasn't something you've already done, something that you've accomplished, and then you're all you're doing is trying to ride that high, &gt;&gt; but it is always ahead of you. Let's go back to Hebrews chapter 12. &gt;&gt; Point number one is simply strengthen your tired hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Strengthen your tired hands. It says in Hebrews chapter 12 in verse three, for consider him who endured such hostility from sinners against himself so that you won't grow weary and give up in struggling against sin. You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And you have not you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons. My son, do not take the Lord's discipline lightly or lose heart when you are reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves and punishes every son he receives. Endure suffering as discipline God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? But if you are without discipline which all receive then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Furthermore, we had human fathers discipline us and we respected them. Shouldn't we submit even more to the father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them. But he does it for our benefit so that we can share in his holiness. No discipline seems enjoyable by the time but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. Therefore, strengthen your tired hands and weakened knees and make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be dislocated but healed instead. Strengthen your tired tired hands. You know, everything in this passage I find is quite the opposite of what we see in the world around us. You know, the idea is that if you're tired, if you're growing weary, you know what you should do? You should give up. It's okay. You know, maybe that path is not for you. Just give up and try something else. &gt;&gt; That's what the world tells you to do. &gt;&gt; You know, if you're being disciplined, you know, discipline is being reformed nowadays. You know, especially if you're in the parenting world. There's this new term called gentle parenting. And it's this it's this concept of, you know, you have, you know, Anna, our daughter is uh two years old and she can't understand a lick of what I'm saying. And so if I try to help teach her something, having a conversation with her, hey Anna, it's not good for you to be jumping up and down because we have neighbors below us and whenever you jump up and down, the neighbors can hear it and it it's it really annoys them. Do you think Anna is going to really understand that? &gt;&gt; NO, &gt;&gt; NOT AT ALL. RIGHT. But it's this concept of, you know, we shouldn't discipline our kids too much because the idea is that discipline breeds resentments. &gt;&gt; But this is all from a false notion that all pain is bad. &gt;&gt; All discomfort is bad. &gt;&gt; And so therefore, anyone that brings discomfort on you is a bad person. So we don't want to bring discomfort on our children because that makes us bad. But that IS ACTUALLY THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THIS PASSAGE is saying. We have to endure discipline. &gt;&gt; And yes, it doesn't feel good for a time, but it produces the fruit of righteousness. &gt;&gt; You know, even this concept, right, how fathers disciplined us based off of what seems good to them. You know, I think it's quite interesting because there is this whole concept of, you know, people actually want you to feel discomfort because it's good for you. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but once again, this whole idea that all discomfort is bad, it's actually demonizing fatherhood. &gt;&gt; It's it's demonizing people wanting what's best for you, even if it doesn't seem good at the moments. &gt;&gt; And so what happens is that this whole wave of what men do, all men are are selfish and wicked. &gt;&gt; But what happens is because we do live in the world, the world is around us, men give into it. &gt;&gt; Come on. They become selfish. &gt;&gt; They become wicked. They become unloyal because why? They want to grow weary. And they do give up and they just give into this false notion of what the world is trying to get them to be. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You know, we've been living backwards our whole lives. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; This whole concept of how we should endure, what we should push through. You know, if your hands are tied or your knees are weak, you know, maybe you're pushing yourself too hard. Maybe it's not worth it. You know, you don't want to experience burnout. So, just give up while you still have a chance. &gt;&gt; You know, this whole idea of if the path is rocky. If the path is bumpy, maybe it's not for you, give up, try again, GO TO A DIFFERENT PATH. BUT ALL OF THIS IS ALL IT'S ALL SELFFOCUSED. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; All you're thinking about is yourself. &gt;&gt; You know, people, especially in my generation, I've been finding it's going it's getting worse and worse. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They can't spell commitment if it was written on the back of their eyelids, &gt;&gt; you know, and it's and it's not it's actually crazy, you know, u being in Bible studies, especially with people around my age, you you'll talk about this like, hey, like we understand what commitment looks like, right? We want to give our 100% to God. Well, imagine if you're in a relationship. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And imagine the person said, \"You know what? I want to give you 99%. just give me one day out of the year where I don't have to think about you &gt;&gt; where I can just give that to anyone that I want. And you paint this analogy and you're like, there's no way they would ever want this. &gt;&gt; But then you get people saying, well, if if that's what they need if if that's what my significant if that's what my significant other needs. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S LIKE WHAT HOW delusional can you be? Like people actually believe this &gt;&gt; that it's okay to be in a relationship where someone gives you 99% if that's what they need. &gt;&gt; You know, people have become so selfish, &gt;&gt; but they're painting it as selfless. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It is all of a sudden disloyalty is a good thing if it's what they need. &gt;&gt; Uncommittment. It's a good thing if it's what they need. &gt;&gt; It's a total lie of Satan. I even think about this whole concept of you know abortion because what is it is this idea of you don't have to be committed &gt;&gt; don't be a MOTHER DON'T BE A FATHER just consider what you want your dreams and only consider that if if you have something in your life a person maybe and it takes time away from your dreams don't do that &gt;&gt; it's not worth it pursue your own interests &gt;&gt; you know constantly all around us it's in movies it's in music, it's in books nowadays, right? It's in psychology, right? They're trying to push this idea of this is actually good for moral developments, right? &gt;&gt; It's all a lie, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Every last bit of it's a lie. &gt;&gt; It's it's enabling us. It's convincing us of just total falsehood from Satan. And this idea that you will be fulfilled and you will be at peace if you drop all the things that bring you discomfort. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that is what basically life is all headed toward. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If it brings you discomfort, drop it. &gt;&gt; If they make you feel uncomfortable, leave them. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; If you don't like what they say, ignore them. In fact, you know, find ways to prove that you're better than them. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; You know, it's the whole idea is you're pursuing what makes you personally happy. &gt;&gt; But here's the thing. There's nothing glamorous about the cross. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's nothing, you know, that that makes discipline that makes disciplehip look like it's a beautiful thing. In fact, it says it quite clearly in this passage. It literally says, \"No, discipline seems enjoyable at the time &gt;&gt; but painful.\" YOU KNOW, GOD'S NOT TRYING TO make it pretty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's not trying to paint disciplehip in a way where it's going to be okay. Become a disciple. It's going to be great. It's all going to be good. you know, persecution's really not that bad. You know, it's, you know, AND DURING THE CROSS, YEAH, IT'S OKAY. LIKE, NO, God is very real &gt;&gt; with the race that we have signed up for. That nothing that is beneficial is enjoyable. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not a single thing that is beneficial is enjoyable. &gt;&gt; But later, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. &gt;&gt; And and here's the difference between the world and a disciple. the world and our sinful nature. We want to eat of the fruit of righteousness. And that if only I could eat of the fruit of righteousness, I could be at peace. Right? But peace doesn't come from eating the fruit of righteousness. It comes from bearing the fruit. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; For others to eat, &gt;&gt; for others to enjoy. Wow. &gt;&gt; So this whole concept of what'll actually bring you peace is when you're not focused on yourself &gt;&gt; is when you're focused on others reaping the benefits of your righteousness. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; That'll bring you peace. &gt;&gt; The moment you start thinking is, \"Oh, what about me? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What about my life?\" That is when you start to go down a slow spiral downwards of complete selfishness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it starts off gradual. &gt;&gt; It starts off slow. And if you're thinking about, I just want fruit so I could enjoy it. That is the trap that Satan has trapped you with. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It's bearing fruit so others can enjoy it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It is bearing the fruit of righteousness that brings peace. But you're the tree. How can you eat the fruit if you're the tree &gt;&gt; is for others to enjoy? &gt;&gt; You know, I find that when we doubt, when we second guess ourselves and we become callous, we have to do what it says here in verse three. We have to consider Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Consider what he went through. &gt;&gt; When you're thinking to yourself, I don't like this. This is uncomfortable. Who is responsible for my discomfort? &gt;&gt; And then lastly, HOW DO I GET OUT OF THIS? You know, that's actually God trying to get you to endure. &gt;&gt; He's trying to get you to learn discipline. And what happens when you endure? You start to mature from it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Discipline is meant to get you to mature. And you know that you're actually maturing, not just tolerating, not just going through the motions, not just surviving whatever you're going through. You know you're maturing when what you're weak in is growing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; If you don't find that your weaknesses are growing, then you are just surviving and you're just tolerating or even worse, you're in that downward spiral right now. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; You have to start to grow in what you're weakened. You know the passage says in verse 12 to strengthen your tired hands &gt;&gt; and your weakened knees. Are you growing in what you're weaken? &gt;&gt; Do you know what you are weak in? &gt;&gt; You know take time whether it be today or this next week to answer that question for yourself. You know what am I weak in? And then take the next step. See if the people closest to you agree. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; See see if it lines up. Pick pick three things that you're weak in and say, \"You know what? I wonder if those closest to me actually agree with this.\" So, you could say, \"Well, I think what I'm weak in is I'm just too overly humble.\" &gt;&gt; Oh, it's uh I'm an overworker. &gt;&gt; You know, in the in the in the job interviews, what what's your greatest flaw? I work too hard. I I I just I just love my job too much. &gt;&gt; And then he talks to those closest to you. And you don't want flattery. Make sure to clarify that. Hey, don't flatter me right now. You know, I I want true encouragement. The kind of encouragement that refineses me. &gt;&gt; Ask those around you, what are my weaknesses? &gt;&gt; What can I grow in? And just see if it matches up. &gt;&gt; Why? Because one, we already know from chapter 11 that we need faith, right? &gt;&gt; We need faith. Why do you need faith? Is because you know God's going to discipline you to refine your faith. &gt;&gt; To mature you, to grow you, to get you to be able to bear fruits. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And then what you need when you are disciplined in your faith is endurance. When you have faith and when you are disciplined and you have endurance, you will mature and you will bear the peaceful fruit of righteousness. Let's keep going in verse 14. &gt;&gt; It says in verse 14, \"Pursue peace with everyone and holiness. Without it, no one will see the Lord.\" Bless you. Make sure that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no root of bitterness springs up causing trouble and defiling many. And make sure that there isn't any immoral or irreverent person like Esau who sold his birthight in exchange for a single meal. For you know that later when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected even though he sought it with tears because he didn't find any opportunity for repentance. Point number two is God will shake the shakers. &gt;&gt; God will shake the shakers. You know, here we'll just break it down. It talks about pursuing peace with everybody, right? And so as a disciple, whether it be other Christians or non-Christians, we want to be at peace with everyone in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there is one distinctive clarifier. You have to be holy. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Meaning you want good relationships, but there's a point where you just draw the line. &gt;&gt; Oh, baby. &gt;&gt; To where you're just not like those around you. And then it talks about bitterness, right? And I find sometimes what we want to focus on is what is bitterness? Well, what does bitterness look like? But I find the way you actually can identify bitterness is by what it says here is are you is does bitterness defile those around you? &gt;&gt; H are people around you being defiled? Whether it be because of you or because of what you see another brother and sister doing. Are people around you being defiled? Well, what does it mean to be defiled? Well, I think of Exodus. how when they were scouting the promised lands and you had 12 men, one of these tribe and only two men, Joshua and Caleb actually had a good report. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It only took 10 men to convince about two million people that is not worth entering the promised lands &gt;&gt; and they spread a negative reports. You know, it's hard to admit that we're bitter because we can argue. It's easy to argue what are the signs of bitterness. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I find let's not focus on what does bitterness look like, but what is the fruit of bitterness? &gt;&gt; That is how you can tell what bitterness is. Is simply is it defiling those around you? Because you can recognize a fruit uh a tree by its fruit. &gt;&gt; We don't have to examine the bark, look at the leaves, look at the way that is growing. is you simply say what kind of fruit is this tree bearing? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And we just already read from another fruit. The other the fruit we want to bear is the peaceful fruit of righteousness, right? &gt;&gt; Which comes from faith, endurance, and discipline. So what does bitterness promote? It promotes faithlessness. &gt;&gt; It produces the desire to give up having no endurance. Or bitterness makes you want to avoid God's discipline. If you find that there's any of these things happening in your life or around you, then you or someone near you is bitter. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; If you find Wow, there I'm hearing people talk about giving up. &gt;&gt; There is bitterness around you. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; I'm hearing people talking about avoiding God's discipline. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Finding ways to make it easier. There is bitterness around you.",

God's discipline, though painful, is a loving act designed to cultivate holiness and yield the peaceful fruit of righteousness, countering the world's self-focused narrative of avoiding discomfort.

        "verse": "Hebrews 12:1-2",
        "insight": "This passage exhorts believers to run the Christian race with endurance, shedding every hindrance and sin, by keeping their gaze fixed on Jesus. Jesus himself, for the joy set before Him, endured the cross and despised its shame. The speaker uses this to illustrate that our ability to endure trials is rooted in what we truly value, understanding that the outcome can make any challenge bearable."

        "verse": "Ecclesiastes 7:10-14",
        "insight": "The sermon applies this passage to challenge the notion that 'former days were better than these,' urging listeners to believe their best days are always ahead. It highlights that God orchestrates both days of prosperity and adversity for our growth and so we cannot foresee the future. This perspective encourages a joyful heart in good times and a reflective one in bad, trusting in God's perfect plan."

        "insight": "This section explains that God's discipline, though not enjoyable at the time, is a sign of His love and is for our ultimate benefit, leading us to share in His holiness. It contrasts the world's encouragement to give up when weary with God's call to 'strengthen tired hands and weakened knees' and endure. Through this process, believers are meant to mature and grow in areas of weakness, bearing the peaceful fruit of righteousness."

        "insight": "The speaker uses this passage to emphasize the pursuit of peace with all people and holiness, without which one cannot see the Lord. It warns against allowing 'a root of bitterness' to spring up, which defiles many, identifying its presence by its fruits of faithlessness, a desire to give up, and avoiding God's discipline. The example of Esau selling his birthright serves as a caution against irreverence and valuing fleeting pleasures over eternal blessings and commitment."

    "book_reference": "Hebrews 11",
    "series_number": 13,
    "transcript": "You know today we will be talking a lot about faith. &gt;&gt; Uh let's go to Hebrews chapter 11. &gt;&gt; A lot about faith. You know Hebrews chapter 11 you know we talk about as of course the nickname is the hall of faith and every single paragraph could be a lesson of its own. I am going to somehow make it one lesson. &gt;&gt; We will see how that goes. Uh let's just read the first few verses. &gt;&gt; It says, \"Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen. For by this our ancestors were approved. By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible. You know, have you guys ever had a conversation with a good friend of yours and it's a deep conversation and you walk away from that conversation with a face that kind of looks like this. &gt;&gt; You know, you're just just pondering. Yes, even if your face isn't like that, your attitude is kind of like that, just like h &gt;&gt; it's a a lot to think about there. &gt;&gt; Not sure not sure where to start. &gt;&gt; Uh we had an incredible de time with the swans last night. &gt;&gt; And um you know, we discipled the swans, but I came out of that talk like this. There's a lot to think about here, but but good things, you know, and just reminiscing on uh Kyle and I's discipling relationship and the things we talked about, I was like, \"Wow, I I don't think I've come to realize truly how selfish I really am.\" And sometimes you just have those conversations and it just it just hits more than any other day. You're like, \"Wow, that's that's me. And you know, I've talked about times when you know, you you see different things on the news and whatnot. And coming off the coattails of realizing how selfish I really am. I was just seeing just some wicked news just happening just very consistently. And then I came to another realization is that I'm not as radical as I need to be. &gt;&gt; Like there's there's so much happening. I saw a video the other day of, bear with me as I describe this. This woman seem seemingly a congresswoman or something was standing in front of what looked like a brick oven, right? It was just a hole in the wall on the outside of a building and it almost seemed as if you're just walking along the street of downtown Tampa. You just all of a sudden you just see what it's like the the oven uh door of a brick oven. And I'm curious what it is that she's talking about. And then she start starts talking. She's right here is our baby drop off station &gt;&gt; and a baby isn't here. The longest time a baby ever sat in this station was 4.5 seconds. I'm like, \"Oh, this is what people do when they don't want to abort their baby. &gt;&gt; They literally drop them in a mystery hole.\" &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; For people to take them. And you know, I'm sure even Earl and Sabrina know about this, but when Nat and I were in India and that part of the world, people um they don't put them in like a baby hole giveaway station, but they literally throw them away. Uh there is a young woman that Natt once studied with that was uh literally found in a dumpster as a as an infant, as a baby. And you know, we've as a society have tried tried to move so far ahead in people's freedom that we're taking steps backwards &gt;&gt; as a society. &gt;&gt; As a culture &gt;&gt; and we have we now have throwing babies away in trash cans, but with a nice ribbon on it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's glorified. And this got me thinking just about the darkness of the world. You know, the the fact that there are people out there, it doesn't matter where you are, where you're from, someone out there, people out there hate you just because of who you are because of the fact that you're not like them and you breathe the same air as them and they hate that. They despise that. You know, you turn on your devices, any device, you see greed constantly, corruption, hate, murder. This is is literally happening all around us. But it's fine. It's fine. Just turn on another TV show, watch, you know, listen to the latest music album, the the latest drama on some internet celebrity, watch the new football game, the new basketball game, the new Stranger Things season. Just distract yourself to not realize what is truly happening all around you. &gt;&gt; And you know, that's how it all started. It all started with the the funny kitten videos. You know, it's like, \"Wow, look what's on the internet. Kitten videos.\" And it's like it's all a distraction and that it's all a ploy by Satan that if you can just build your castle walls high enough that you forget what the rest of society really looks like. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just live like a king, live like a queen, have your luxuries, strive for luxuries, and then you forget what life is really like around you. And it just got me thinking why why is it that at times we can feel I'm I'm talking about myself here is why can we feel indifferent at times? Why can we feel unmotivated at times about the state of the world? Why as disciples do we know that we have this great gift, this great blessing, yet we still struggle. &gt;&gt; We still struggle with sin. We still struggle with trying to live like Christ, live righteously. You know, I I find that the reason why is because we're not letting faith run its course in our lives. &gt;&gt; We're not letting faith do its job with us. &gt;&gt; And what is faith meant to do? When I read this passage, it literally says is re faith is the reality of what is hoped for and the proof of what is not seen. Faith gets you to wake up to reality. see the world and see how you are for what it truly is. And then the other thing it does is it gets you to live by what you do not see. Live according to what you do not see. You know faith is hoping for a reality that you know is there although you cannot see it. I find what is faith? Faith is God's reality. &gt;&gt; Faith is God's reality and it is our salvation. And you know, maybe today you're struggling in your face. &gt;&gt; You're struggling with faith. Maybe you're unsure or even afraid of what the future holds for you, what God has in store for you. Maybe you're fearful or unwanting of where a Christlike life will lead you. What'll happen if you truly imitate Christ? Or you're just simply doubting disciplehip. if it's even worth the risk and if it is it really as good or as perilous as people say that it is. You know, I find that if you're struggling with your faith, it means that you haven't woken up to what the world truly is yet. &gt;&gt; You you're not yet living in God's reality. You know, God wants all of us to open our eyes. All of us to see the state of the world and then to be motivated enough to change our lives and to change the lives of others around us. That is faith. Our title is simply faith is God's reality. &gt;&gt; Faith is God's reality. And after today, after looking at Hebrews 11, if you still feel like you're sitting on the fence between a faithful life and a faithless life, I hope that you know it is simply because you lack faith. &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. Hebrews 11:4, &gt;&gt; it says, \"By faith, Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith, he was approved as a righteous man because God approved his gifts. And even though he is dead, he still speaks through his faith. By faith, Enoch was taken away. And so, he did not experience death. He was not to be found because God took him away. For before he was taken away, he was approved as one who pleased God. Now, without faith, it is impossible to please God. Since the one who draws near to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. By faith, Noah, after he was warned, warned about what was not yet seen and motivated by godly fear, built an ark to deliver his family. And by faith, he condemned the world and became an heir of righteousness that comes by faith. By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed and set out for a place that he was going to receive as an inheritance. He went out even though he did not know where he was going. And by faith he stayed as a foreigner in the land of promise, living in tents as did Isaac and Jacob, co-airs of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations whose architect and builder is God. Point number one is faith looks forward. Faith looks forward. You know, we have a few examples here and each of these names, they could be a lesson of themselves. So I'll just try to briefly talk about them. You know, you have Abel. Abel with his faith was able to objectively give. I didn't realize that words there. But he gave an objectively better sacrifice than his brother when there was no law. There is no command. Why? Because he had faith that that is the kind of God that he serves. A God that wants our best, you know. Then there's Enoch. He had faith and with his faith he was able to please God. Noah was able to obey God and literally knew a flood was coming without any signs of this because he had faith in God. But the one I want to hone in on the most is Abraham. Abraham at the age of 75 years old. &gt;&gt; He took his wife, &gt;&gt; his nephew, all his possessions and moved to a place that he knew nothing about because of his faith in God. And he literally stayed there as a foreigner. And why? It says because he was looking forward to God's city. Faith always looks forward. You know, I find that the opposite of a faith that looks forward is trying to live your life in survival mode. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. living your life where you're just going through the motions or you're you're daydreaming about a life that is not really concerned of the desires of God, &gt;&gt; but of your own personal desires. &gt;&gt; You know, I'll I'll be blunt here. The American dream is choking our lives. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; The American dream is choking our lives. What What is What is quite simply the the American dream? You get a degree. You get money, you get a house, you find a spouse, and then once you're old enough, you find a very secluded part of America, live there the rest of your lives, and keep voting for other people to do the same thing as the economy collapses in a society where people don't really care for the elderly anymore. &gt;&gt; That's essentially the American dream. &gt;&gt; Just get yourself, sit in a corner, and shut up. That's that's the dream. That's the life. Ju just build your walls high enough to where you don't even care what's happening outside of it. &gt;&gt; And I find that really none of those things are objectively bad. Having the degree, having a house, but I find the difference in this lifestyle that society wants us to live is the complete opposite of the example of Abraham. to where at 75 years old he's he's still daydreaming about the city that God has for him. &gt;&gt; You know, it says in another passage that he believes that his body was as good as dead. Yet, he still sits there thinking about what's yet to come. &gt;&gt; A a city that he is yet to inhabit yet that he could sit there and think there's no points. My life is at the end of his limbs here. But but yet he was still thinking about the future that God has in store for him. You know, you can't let the American dream kill God's dream in your life. &gt;&gt; You know, I find the difference is this is the the American dream wants you to make God a a piece of the puzzle of the life that you are building and that he's just simply one part of it, one percentage of it. And you live that way. You know, God is good, but he's only second to the pursuit of my life. &gt;&gt; A piece of the pursuit of my life. But what did Abraham do when God gave him the vision? He said, he gave him the promise that the that you will have, you know, ancestry line as numerous as the stars in the sky, as the sand on the seashore. That he says, \"That's a great plan, God. I'm going to bring my family with me. I'm going to bring my possessions with me. And I find that what happens is that we want to instead make our life part of the pursuit of God. We make God part of the pursuit of our life. But it we have to take our family with us. We have to take our life with us. You know, we can't get lost in God's dream and forget our lives. Meaning that you could try to make God's concerns so much in your life, you start to neglect your family. &gt;&gt; You start to neglect those who God has actually given you. &gt;&gt; But God doesn't want you to go so far off the deep end and pursue his dream and forget your life. Nor should you go so far off the deep end and pursue your life and forget God. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; You have to bring your life with you. Let's keep going. Let's go to Hebrews 11:1. &gt;&gt; We're going to come back to Abraham later and circle back around. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11:1 it says, \"By faith, even Sarah herself, when she was unable to have children, received power to conceive offspring, even though she was past the age, since she considered that the one who had promised was faithful. Therefore, from one man, in fact, from one as good as Zed, came offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky, as numerable as the grains of the sand along the seashore. These all died in faith, although they had not received the things that were promised. They saw them from a distance, greeted them, and confessed that they were foreigners and temporary residents of the earth. Now, those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they were thinking about where they had come from, they would not have had they would have an opportunity to return. But they now desire a better place, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. By faith, Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. He received the promises, and yet he was offering his one and only son, the one to whom they had been said, \"Your offering will be traced through Isaac.\" He considered God to be able even to raise someone from the dead. Therefore, he received them back figuratively speaking. By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the things to come. By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and he worshiped, leaning on this the top of his staff. By faith, Joseph, as he was nearing the end of his life, mentioned the Exodus of the Israelites, and gave instructions concerning his bones. Point number two is that death cannot stop faith. &gt;&gt; Death cannot stop faith. You know, you see here you have Sarah, right? She received the power to conceive as she was reaching the end of her life when it was illogical and improbable for her to bear children. Yet, she had faith. She laughed at it at first, but then she had faith later. Amen. you know, and she along with everyone else, it says that they died without ever letting go in faith. &gt;&gt; They died in faith. Even if they didn't get to see its fulfillments. &gt;&gt; You know what's really incredible about the pattern of the Bible is that God would make a promise, very few people would actually get to live that promise. Um, and then God would just make another promise. Take for example God promising Abraham this innumerable offspring but he never saw it. He died before it happens. And then you know later on he also promises the the conquering of the land of Canaan the promised lands but he never got to saw it get to see it. But then if anything, his family goes through 400 years of slavery. So there's literally hundreds of years of descendants of Abraham who actually never got to live in the promised land though God promised. And then once they actually got into the promised land, God had another promise. So they fulfilled that promise, but then God just made another one of the kingdom to come, of Jesus to come. And so it was almost like whenever a promise was actually fulfilled, God would just make another one. So like literally like the that God was trying to point everything towards a certain direction to where there was really one final promise that God was trying to get to. And we know about it. Jesus comes and says, \"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see because prophets and kings long to see them.\" &gt;&gt; The the ears that you have because prophets and kings, they they long to hear about it. And what it was that final promise Jesus was that God was trying to get to that was Jesus &gt;&gt; at the very end. &gt;&gt; But yet you have thousands of years of men and women never getting to see that &gt;&gt; and yet they still died in faith. &gt;&gt; You know how often do we lose faith when we feel like God isn't fulfilling our prayers? Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; How how easy it is it to to lose faith when you feel like things aren't going your way? Literally, it didn't go their way for hundreds of years, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But they died in faith. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it wasn't about what any anything that could be given to you. It wasn't about the promises. It wasn't about the blessings. It wasn't about THE COMMANDS OF GOD. ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. It was just simply about faith and about God and about the truth that that he is real and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. &gt;&gt; You know, I find that this is the truth that there is nothing on earth that you can have that makes disciplehip worth it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing on earth that you could have that makes disciplehip worth it. Think about it. You you you you share your faith and you want someone to become a disciple. Maybe it's your friend, maybe it's a family member. And let's say they make it and you're like, \"Finally, I the only reason why I became a disciple was so this person become a disciple. This this is what I signed up for, God. This is this is what I did.\" No. Right. No one thinks like that. Same thing. Go. Let's say even going on a mission team. You know, I did it. The only reason why I became the disciple was so I can be a foreigner in another land, not knowing where I am. This is all just mysterious and confusing. And this is great. I'm sure Earl, Sabria, Julia, and other kid, right? But but no one actually, that's not why we signed up to be disciples. That's not why we're doing what we're doing. Or even maybe it's like, you know, I I became a disciple because I just love giving advice. No one listened to me in the world. So I I just have consistent quiet times and all of a sudden people like me. People like what I have to say because I read my Bible every day. This is This is it. this this was what I signed up for. You know, I find whether it's a command of God or a promise of God, none of those things are why we do what we do. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you can't have faith in something that is tangible. &gt;&gt; You could measure how many people you share your faith with. &gt;&gt; Objectively, you can't. You can just count it. You can, you know, measure how many mission teams you go on. You can measure how much contribution you give. You literally there there are so many things you can measure. So many things that you can visibly see and because of those things you cannot have your faith in that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The moment you can measure it, the moment it is tangible, it is not worthy of faith. &gt;&gt; So that's what it means. There is nothing on earth that makes you know disciplehip worth it &gt;&gt; because you can grasp it. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's tangible. is visible. It's not worth having faith in. And so then what makes our disciplehip valuable? What makes disciplehip worth it? It is I find it's just one thing. Disciplehip is worth it when you have faith when you die. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Having faith when you die, having faith until you die. That you could do all these things, but if you don't die in faith, none of it was worth it. Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much God gives you. It doesn't matter how many people you helped. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how many people you brought into heaven. But if you do not die in faith, it wasn't worth it for you. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; You have to die in faith. And you have to have faith until you die. You know, they did not receive what was promised because it wasn't about that. It was simply about their faith. Why? Because faith was all they had. They had they they didn't have the promises. They didn't have these great things. They didn't have the kingdom. They didn't have the word. They didn't have the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was in a temple. If you wanted to go to temple, you first there was sins in your life. You brought an animal sacrifice and then but once you leave the temple, the temple was the spirit wasn't with you. It was out of location. But we have all these great amazing things with us. But yet our faith still lacks at times. our faith can still be lacking. Why? Because we're not focused on the fact that it's only about faith. That's all that it has ever been about. You know, you have to let faith consume you. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Because once faith consumes you, nothing can buy you. Nothing can stop you. That death cannot even finish you. That literally once you die, you just go to a new location. That you go to a new and better city. You know, it's amazing seeing what Abraham did. Abraham was told to move and he took his family with him and then he was given a promise that through Isaac the world will be blessed. And then God said, \"I am now taking your son Isaac.\" And then it literally says uh that he received him back figuratively speaking. Meaning that the moment God asked for him, before he even sacrificed him, God says, \"You're right. he's already yours and that he reasoned that God would just raise him from the dead. That it wasn't about whether he had his son or not. It was about that God never fails his promises. That God never takes back his promises. That if God says something that he will certainly do it, even if it wasn't in his lifetime, even if he never got to see it, that God will always do what he says he will do. And that is faith. That is faith. You know, think about the things that we want to have faith in. To see the world evangelize &gt;&gt; to the to to see those around us make it into heaven. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you might look at your life and you might feel like, well, I don't think that's happening around me. &gt;&gt; Am I really the vessel that God wants to make this happen? &gt;&gt; Well, it's not about whether it happens or not. &gt;&gt; It's about whether you have faith in God. &gt;&gt; And that's what matters. having faith the moment that you die. You know, the other people that it mentions, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, they all had something in common, and it was that they had faith in something that they objectively could not see in their lifetimes. Isaac blessed Jacob that he would not get to see what would happen in Jacob's life. Jacob blessed Joseph's sons and he would never get to see what would happen in their lives. Joseph hoped that he he would be buried in the promised land while they were still slaves in Egypt. He would have never seen it. But he knew he had faith that his bones would make it to the promised lands. You know, faith is never supposed to die with you. &gt;&gt; It's never meant to die with you. It is something that you always pass along. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it is something that yes, you you have the faith and even if you do not see it, you pass it on to the next person &gt;&gt; because it's not about whether you receive it or not. &gt;&gt; I find that if death cannot stop your faith, then neither can anything else. &gt;&gt; And when you know that you can die in faith and pass it along, then that is what makes faith real and that nothing else can stop us. But let's keep going. Point number three is faith sees what others can't. &gt;&gt; Faith sees what others can't. In verse 23, the Bible says, \"By faith, Moses after he was born, was hidden by his parents for three months because they saw that the child was beautiful and they didn't fear the king's edict. By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter and chose to suffer with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. For he considered reproach for the sake of Christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt since he was looking ahead to the reward. By faith he left Egypt behind, not being afraid of the king's anger. For Moses pers persevered as one who sees him who is invisible. By faith he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch the Israelites. By faith they crossed the Red Sea as though they were on dry land. When the Egyptians attempted to do this, they were drowned. Faith can see what others can't. You know, Moses, his parents, they weren't afraid of the fact that the ruler of the land was wiping out all of the young males. They were willing to hide their child. And in Moses' faith, he literally turned down the riches of being a king, a a prince in the greatest nation that at that time existed so that he can suffer for the sake of Christ. is that he persevered as one uh who sees him who is invisible. You know, I find I that's the big question that I find I ask myself I ask myself a lot. How do I live as if I've seen God? &gt;&gt; Like how can I have the faith of an apostle who literally saw Jesus? How can I have the faith of Moses who saw the burning bush? How how can I have this faith uh that they had when they literally saw a massive pillar of fire moving through the wilderness that parted the Red Sea? How can I have that level of faith? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, faith it's it's intangible, right? Um so it's not something that can be measured. So we have to really backtrack a little bit. So if we want to have faith as if we've seen God, you know, the the we want to live as if we've seen God, then of course we have to have faith. It's the same exact question. How do we have faith is the same question as how do we live as if we've seen God? But where does faith come from? Faith comes from hearing the word. But not everyone who hears the word has faith. Amen. If everyone who heard the word automatically had faith, this world would have been won 10 times over. So yes, faith comes from hearing the word of Christ, but there's something that actually comes before that. You know, think of the four soils, the path, the rocky soil, the thorny soil, and the good soil. &gt;&gt; You have to have the right hearts. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; So, yes, faith comes from hearing the word. But if you don't have the right the right hearts, then the word's not going to have its effect on you. &gt;&gt; You're not going to have faith from the word. So, you have to have Yes, you have to have a soft heart. You have to have a humble heart to receive the word. Why? Because the word cuts you. If you don't have a soft heart, then when the word tries to cut you, it's just going to bounce right off. So, how do you have faith? Yes, you have to hear the word, but you have to have a soft heart. &gt;&gt; You have to have a heart of flesh. &gt;&gt; So, where does a hard heart come from? How do you have a hard heart? &gt;&gt; We actually already read this in Hebrews 3. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 3 real quick. In verse 13, it says, \"But encourage each other daily while it's still called today, so that none of you is hardened by sin's deception.\" What hardens your hearts? The deceitfulness of sin. &gt;&gt; The deceitfulness of sin. So, we want to have faith. We want to live as if we've seen God. But the roadblock is our hard hearts. &gt;&gt; What causes a hard heart is sin's deception. We have to ask ourselves, what lies are we listening to? How are we being deceived by sin? And of course, the thing we think about is that we're in sin and we believe it's okay. That that is the deception of us. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; That that sin is good. That sin is okay. That sin is normal, right? Well, the people around me do it. Their lives look okay. &gt;&gt; Is is my sin really that bad? Or you're oblivious to it. people time after time again again are trying to tell you your sin but you're like well it's not really that bad because this is happening in my life and then this is happening and you're making excuses for your sin I find that is the common practice of sin deceitfulness but I find that there's other lies that we can listen to lies like no one cares about me &gt;&gt; you know I I come to church and I feel I feel unloved &gt;&gt; and that is a lie Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; You know, other lies like I feel like I'm I'm not changing anything. I feel like I'm not even changing. I feel like I can't change. The these are very common lies, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That we tell ourselves, saying things like, \"I'm not really making a difference here. &gt;&gt; There's no one's lies that I'm really impacting.\" And these are all lies that sin is trying to get you to believe. And it hardens our hearts. And it's really no wonder why we feel faithless because our heart is hard by sin's deception. And in order to see what other people don't see, in order to live as if we've seen God, we cannot live how others live. &gt;&gt; We cannot live how others live. You know, we try to imitate the lives of people that we see online. And it's no wonder why we're faithless. &gt;&gt; You know what? That life looks good. If I could only have a piece of that, that life looks good. If I I just want some of that. BUT THE REASON WHY YOU'RE faithless is because you're doing that. &gt;&gt; You're hardened by sin's deception. And you know, we try to please people. We try to focus on ourselves. And it's no wonder why we're struggling. It's because we're trying to fit our faith into a box &gt;&gt; when we have to let it completely take control of our lives. You know, God's reality has to be our reality. Yes, &gt;&gt; we have to see the world for what it truly is. Sin for what it really does to you. People for how sin and how it really enslaves every single one of us. And that we have to see the reality that God wants us all to enter his city. Let's close out in Hebrews 11:32. It says, \"And what more can I say? Time is too short for me to tell you about Gideon, Barack, Samson, Jeffa, David, Samuel, and the prophets, who by faith conquered kingdoms, and ministered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the raging of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, gained strength and weakness, became mighty in battle, and put foreign armies to flight. Women received their dead, raised to life again. Other people were tortured, not accepting release, so they might gain a better resurrection. Others experienced mockings and scorgings as well as bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned. They were saw in two. They died by the sword. They wandered in sheepkin and goat skin, destitute, afflicted, mistreated. The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and on mountains, hiding in caves and holes in the ground. All these were approved through their faith, but they did not receive what was promised. Since God had provided something better for us so that they would not be made so they would not be made perfect without us. You know, faith must be passed on. Faith must be passed on. You see, it's amazing that they all died in faith never receiving what is promised. But it says that they are made perfect through us. You know, they died never receiving any of that God promised them. But it's only worth it when we continue to live in faith. &gt;&gt; We cannot make their sacrifices in vain. The moment that we draw back in our faith or become faithless, it literally makes all of this meaningless in our lives. We have to let faith be passed on. You know, because what is the ultimate promise since the time of Genesis is Jesus being revealed. It is the Messiah. It is God walking the earth. That every single time someone follows, obeys, and imitates Christ, it just makes their sacrifice all the more worthless. And now that we have these great things promised to us, our faith has to be so much greater. We cannot continue to make excuses for our hard hearts. We cannot continue to make excuses for sin in our lives. &gt;&gt; We cannot continue to make excuses for faithlessness, hopelessness, living in lies that that we know that Satan is trying to make us believe. We have to let faith continue to push us forward. You know, there is a dark reality to this world. We cannot drown it out. &gt;&gt; We cannot pretend like it's not there. We cannot just drown ourselves in entertainment in the American dream. This desire for more possessions AND PRETEND LIKE SOMEHOW SOMEWAY the world will get better on its own. &gt;&gt; That God that Jesus literally says that if YOU DO NOT PROFESS his name that the stones will cry out, someone will change the state of the world. And God is hoping that it's you. God &gt;&gt; God is hoping that it is you who do not make the sacrifices of all those who died without a promise, without a fulfillment in vain. And that if you're here today, that that literally could be now. If you're feeling faithless, you can turn that all behind you. If you have a hard heart, you can have a soft heart. That you always have a choice. &gt;&gt; Don't pretend you don't have a choice. Don't make excuses like you don't have a choice. That you can continue to live in faith. that all faith is really is living in God's reality. You don't have to live in this reality that you set up for yourself, that there's no hope, that there is no reason, that there is no point, that no one loves you, that no one cares, that the world cannot be changed. That is all a false reality that the world is trying to get you to believe every single second of this day. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You have to see the world for what it truly is. So let us have faith and let us live in God's reality. To God be all the glory.",

    "summary": "Malik Speckman's sermon, \"Faith Is God's Reality,\" deeply explores Hebrews 11, defining faith as God's ultimate reality and the lens through which believers should view the world. He presents three key points: faith looks forward, death cannot stop faith, and faith sees what others cannot. The sermon challenges listeners to resist worldly distractions like the 'American dream' and fight sin's deception, which hardens the heart and hinders faith. Ultimately, it calls for a life consumed by faith, one that is passed on to others, aligning entirely with God's reality and purpose.",

        "verse": "Hebrews 11:1-3",
        "insight": "This passage defines faith as the reality of what is hoped for and the proof of what is not seen. The speaker explains that faith helps individuals wake up to God's reality, see the world for what it truly is, and live according to what they do not visibly perceive, hoping for a reality they know exists. It's presented as the very essence of God's reality itself, contrasting with perceived visible realities."

        "verse": "Hebrews 11:4-10",
        "insight": "These verses exemplify how faith looks forward, highlighting figures like Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham. Abraham's obedience in leaving his home for an unknown inheritance and his anticipation of 'the city that has foundations whose architect and builder is God' are particularly emphasized. This illustrates a faith that transcends immediate desires and 'survival mode,' focusing instead on God's ultimate, unseen plan for the future."

        "verse": "Hebrews 11:11-22",
        "insight": "This section underscores that death cannot stop faith, using Sarah's miraculous conception and the many who died in faith without receiving all the promises as examples. Abraham's willingness to offer Isaac is presented as a supreme test of faith in God's ability to raise the dead, signifying that God never fails His promises. The sermon concludes that discipleship's true value lies in maintaining faith until death and passing it on, even if its full fruition isn't witnessed in one's lifetime."

        "verse": "Hebrews 11:23-29",
        "insight": "Moses is highlighted as an example of faith that allows one to 'see what others can't.' His parents defied the king's edict to save him, and Moses later chose suffering with God's people over the fleeting pleasures of Egyptian royalty, enduring 'as one who sees him who is invisible.' This illustrates that faith enables believers to perceive God's unseen reality and act courageously against worldly fears and temptations."

      {
        "verse": "Hebrews 3:13",
        "insight": "This verse is used to explain the primary cause of a hardened heart, which hinders faith: 'sin's deception.' The speaker teaches that believing lies—such as sin being acceptable, feeling unloved, or thinking one cannot change—are deceptions that harden our hearts. To cultivate faith and 'live as if we've seen God,' one must possess a soft, humble heart that allows God's word to penetrate and expose these deceptive lies."

    "transcript": "this lesson uh uh you know have a sub a subheader a lesson to myself and I pray as I read these passages you know speak on what they mean that uh you guys can find how it relates to your guys' life as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, uh I can remember times in my disciplehip, whether sometimes even before disciplehip really thinking that God is far from me right now, you know, not being able to people say in different ways. They say feel his presence. They can't tell if if God really loves them, if God really has their best interests in mind. Maybe you've thought this before, maybe you're thinking this right now, you know, and it would come in different forms, right? It's like I would ask myself, is is God really near me? Is God really around me? And and it feels like as if my best effort still doesn't make that relationship any closer at times, that it feels like I'm doing all that I can. And kind of like Elizabeth said, what's the point? I I feel like God's not any closer. And you know, it even feels as if, you know, God has turned away from me. I'm doing all that I can, God, but but why doesn't it feel like you're close to me? And and this story of me putting all in, me putting my best foot forward and and not seeing at least not feeling like the relationship is really getting any closer and instead feeling like a hope is crushed, a dream is crushed. You know, it's really not my story and God's. &gt;&gt; It's actually God's story with us. And I find what happens is in our victimhood, we rewrite history. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; We rewrite the narrative. We rewrite the story of who is the actual victim in my life. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; The answer should be Jesus. &gt;&gt; But often times we think it's us. &gt;&gt; I think it's me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This sense of loss that we could feel, a broken relationship, a dream killed. You know, God never gave up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He never gives up on us. He He's not the one who lost hope. &gt;&gt; He's not the one that had something and then we took it and killed it. Well, as though he took it from us and then he killed it, but rather we took it from him. &gt;&gt; We took Jesus and we killed him. And so we have to be careful not to rewrite history with us as the victims. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When we're the perpetrators. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; When we're the oppressors in this story. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 10. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And I find that when you as a disciple paint yourself as the victim, there's really only one thing you will start doing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And that is drawing back. Preaching. Yes. &gt;&gt; That is drawing back. And every little decision that you MAKE IS PART OF ONE SIMPLE decision of I'm drawing back now. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I'm the victim in this story and I'm taking steps back. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Whether it's backing down, giving up, drawing back, slowly but surely or or even immediately, you start to draw back. &gt;&gt; Come on. And and I know I felt that at times. I felt that at different times, not even one singular time. And maybe, just maybe, some of you guys could relate to that. &gt;&gt; Feeling that at times. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're feeling it right now. &gt;&gt; You're considering drawing back. And I hope in this lesson, you can really start to tell Satan to stop whispering in your ear. &gt;&gt; That's right. that you're GOING TO DO THE OPPOSITE of drawing back. You're going to draw near still. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to draw near to God. My title for us is simply draw back or draw near. &gt;&gt; Draw back or draw near. Hebrews chapter 10 and verse one. It says, \"Since Allah has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the reality itself of those things, it can never perfect the worshippers by the same sacrifices they continue offer year after year. Otherwise, wouldn't they have stopped being offered since the worshippers being uh purified once and for all would no longer have any conscious of sin conscious of sin. But in the sacrifices there is a reminder of sins each year, year after year. For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. Therefore, he has he was coming into the world. He said, \"You did not desire sacrifice and offering, but you prepared a body for me. You did not delight in whole burnt offerings and sin offerings. Then I said, see, it is written about me. In the scroll, I have come to do your will, God.\" After he says above, \"You did not desire or delight in sacrifices and offerings, whole burnt offerings, and in sin offerings which are offered according to the law,\" he then says, \"See, I have come to do your will.\" He takes away the first to establish the second. By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time. You know that sacrifice that Jesus made for you was for your past, for your present AND ONCE FOR ALL TIME IS for your future as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we want to come back to that point about his sacrifice for your future. But our point number one is remember who he is. &gt;&gt; Remember who he is. &gt;&gt; You know it starts off saying that the law is a shadow that uh that it is simply uh not it in and of itself what God wants to come but the s what God really wants to come would come later and that is in Jesus Christ right that that these sacrifices can never perfect the worshipper and that yet they are still offered year after year. uh when we were at uh Rowlet Park, I believe that's the name of the park, you know, I I mentioned how sometimes we can adopt an Old Testament way of thinking in our New Testament theology &gt;&gt; that that that we in this new covenant and the covenant of Jesus Christ can start to think like they did in the Old Testaments. You know, here it says they offered sacrifices continually, but it says quite simply what they don't do. They don't purify you. They don't remove your conscience for sins. That they don't even take away your sins. You know, I find that there's things that God commands us to do, but we can miss the point entirely. And I find specifically we can start to treat sin confession as animal sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Where you do it consistently, &gt;&gt; constantly, but your mind is not transforming. Come on. &gt;&gt; Your conscience is not changing. &gt;&gt; That that your your mind is not renewing and that you're stuck and you're DOING IT TIME AFTER TIME, MAYBE TEXT AFTER TEXT, TALKING TO THIS DISCIPER, this mentor, this brother and sister in YOUR HOUSEHOLD, BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY BETTER. &gt;&gt; COME ON, BRO. Preach it. &gt;&gt; That's an Old Testament's way of thinking. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And if you remember, it's not your physical practices that determine your spirituality. It's your spirituality that determines your physical practices. &gt;&gt; You know, I find what happens when you're confessing and confessing, but you're not getting any better. You're you're you're hitting a brick wall &gt;&gt; is because you're focused on the wrong confession. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; The confession you should be really focused on is that Jesus is Lord. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. AND WHEN YOU HAVE AND YOUR FOCUS ON THIS true confession, WHAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU DO SIN IS GODLY SORROW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And godly sorrow, that's what's going to lead to repentance, not just consistent sin confession. It is obedience to God. But if you confess your sins, but don't have godly sorrow, you're going to do it right again &gt;&gt; over and over again. &gt;&gt; That's right. Preach it, bro. &gt;&gt; What What is godly sorrow? Godly sorrow is that Jesus is the focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. and that he is the perfect sacrifice. &gt;&gt; So then what is worldly sorrow? &gt;&gt; You are the focus and you're the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE VICTIM. Look what this person did TO ME. LOOK AT I WASN'T GIVING ALL MY heart in singing God because the person next to me wasn't giving all their heart in singing. I wasn't having consistent quiet times. I KEEP HEARING OTHER people struggling in their quiet times. You know, Lord, well, you know, I WAS JUST WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS IN the world and but they're JUST SO WORLDLY. I JUST COULDN'T help myself. &gt;&gt; But it's not about what goes into the body that defiles you. There's no outside thing that truly defiles you. It is your own hearts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But what happens is in worldly sorrow, we paint ourselves as the victim in our story. &gt;&gt; Oh, bro. &gt;&gt; As the ultimate sacrifice. But God, he's trying to get our attention, saying, \"You're not THE SACRIFICE HERE. LOOK AT MY WORD FROM GENESIS to Revelation. The whole point is Jesus.\" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not the sacrifice. You're not the victim. It is your sin that is putting Jesus on the cross. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; You know, and I have, and this is really I said this is me preaching to myself, and I hope you guys can relate here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what happens is instead of having godly sorrow, I have what I am going to start calling Malikly sorrow. &gt;&gt; I have malle sorrow &gt;&gt; where I'm the sacrifice. I'm the victim. &gt;&gt; And maybe sometimes you guys might feel the same. &gt;&gt; You know, whether it's Wesley sorrow, &gt;&gt; you know, whether it's Liz Lee Sorrow, &gt;&gt; you know, Alex Lee Sorrow, right? Like may maybe you START TO FEEL LIKE WELL I'm the victim in this story here God. Yeah. This Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you find yourself unchanging, &gt;&gt; unmotivated, &gt;&gt; un unwilling to good do God's will, unrepented of your sins, you have to ask God and answer this question honestly. Who is the sacrifice here? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Who's the sacrifice here? Who is the victim in your life? Is it you or is it Jesus? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, until you could answer that question honestly, you will continue to draw back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; You will continue to take steps backwards. And I find, you know, we're disciples here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We do want to draw near and we since AS A DISCIPLE, WE DO CONSISTENTLY draw near. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But there are times when maybe we take a few steps back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And those times when you take steps back, it's because you're painting yourself as the victim here. Come on. &gt;&gt; You're painting yourself as a sacrifice. But we have to remember who is this all about. We have to remember who he is. Let's keep reading. In verse 11, &gt;&gt; it says, \"Every priest stands day after day ministering and offering the same sacrifices time after time, which can never take away sins. But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God. He is now waiting until his enemies are made his foottool. For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified. Once again that sacrifice for your sins past, present and future. He has perfected you forever the moment you allowed him to wash away your sins. You the Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. For after he says, \"This is the covenant I will make with them after those days.\" The Lord says, \"I will put my law on their hearts and write them on their minds, and I will never again remember their sins and their lawless acts.\" Now, where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. You know, Jesus forgave us all of our sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And says that he is now seated at the right hand of God. You see what when you try to maybe you haven't quite visualize you painting yourself as the victim. Well, let me put it another way is you're trying to take control. &gt;&gt; It says Jesus as the perfect sacrifice makes his enemies his foottool. But what happens is if you try to be the victim and you're the center of this story, then when you get raised, THE ENEMIES ARE YOUR FOOTTOOL. &gt;&gt; COME ON, BRO. That's you're in power. That's you're in control. But I I think it's important to realize that it's actually great that Jesus is the one that has the enemies under his foottool. Cuz as long as he's in control, he's the one I have to follow. If I have to make up my own rules, figure out my own way to get to heaven, that would not be fun. And as long as he is the perfect sacrifice, he is the perfect mediator, then he is the perfect one that we give all humble submission to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let's keep reading in verse 19. It says, \"Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus, he has inaugurated for us a new and living way through the curtain, that is through his flesh. And since we have a great high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed in pure water. Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering since he who promised is faithful. And let us consider one another in order to provoke love and good works, not neglecting to gather together as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other in all the more as you see the day approaching. Point number two, remember what he did for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember what he did for you. And here it starts off with the therefore statements. And whenever it says therefore in the Bible, you got to realize that it's summary a lot of previously things said, previous statements, right? So the question is how far back is it summarizing? Right? So first it says boldness to enter the sanctuary. That comes from Hebrews 9:25. So at least a chapter before. Same thing. It says the curtain that is his flesh. Also Hebrews 9:es 3 and 8. But then it says that he is our great high priest. That goes all the way back to Hebrews chapter 2. So really when it's saying therefore, it's literally taking all the other nine and a half 10 and a half chapters and saying this is the point of all of this. &gt;&gt; This is the direction that we're going. So right after it says therefore and it gives brief statements on things previously said in different chapters, it gives us three let us statements. So it's not just therefore and dwell on it, but it's therefore let us take action in these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what are the three things? In verse 22, it says, \"Let us draw near. Let us draw near.\" &gt;&gt; Verse 23, \"Let us hold on.\" &gt;&gt; And in verse 24, let us consider one another. You know, I find this is typically in order of of how we do it. You first think to yourself before you become a Christian, I want to be close to God. I want to draw near. Right. Okay. That's grace. AND AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD ASSUME WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY. We want to all draw near. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The second thing is let us hold on. Now, it's not just draw near to God, but it's to stay close to him, to endure, to be a disciple until the very end. But it doesn't end there. The next thing is, who am I going to take with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Who am I considering? And if we're going to get real specific here, it's your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; It's your family. It's those who are also trying to do the previous two things. Who else WANTS TO DRAW NEAR? WHO ELSE WANTS TO HOLD ON? &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; And we have to consider one another. You know, the word in verse 24 says to provoke, to provoke one another towards love and good works. &gt;&gt; You know that word, it comes from the Greek word to sharpen. But that word itself, right, to provoke, it's only mentioned one other time in the Bible. That specific word in Acts 15:39 when Paul and Barnabas had a sharp disagreement. So I want you to think about this. To provoke one another towards loving good deeds. The only other time that word is mentioned is when two brothers have a sharp disagreements. &gt;&gt; Come on. you know, since moving here, the two brothers that I'm closest to are pointing to each other right now and AND I'M THESE ARE THE TWO BROTHERS I'M CLOSEST to here, right? And I talk to them quite consistently. And for for me because I talk to them consistently just in consequence of frequent talking to them we have the most frequent amount of disagreements you know but it's it's quite amazing because as often as we disagree that I find myself only getting closer to them &gt;&gt; only being now I I I only I only find myself wanting to do more for others around me, &gt;&gt; you know. And who here is married? &gt;&gt; Okay, keep your hand up if you're married &gt;&gt; to a to a husband or wife, right? Okay. Who &gt;&gt; I saw I SAW A SINGLE person raise their hand, so that's fine. &gt;&gt; Okay, if you're married, keep your hand up if you've ever DISAGREE WITH YOUR SPOUSE. OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. &gt;&gt; OKAY. All right. Now, next question. When you work out your disagreements, doesn't it get way better? &gt;&gt; Isn't your relationship closer than it was before? &gt;&gt; That's the whole point of this passage. You put your hands down. &gt;&gt; Provoking one another, working out our differences, and then being better because of this. You know, it it literally says that we consider one another to provoke love and good works. You know, if we want to sharpen one another, what does sharpening do? Well, when you know, iron hits iron or a sharper object hits a slightly, you know, more dense objects, what does it hap what happens? There's there's sparks. Why? Because of heat and friction. &gt;&gt; That that is going to be your discipling relationships. your your relationships with your household wi-i &gt;&gt; with with your brothers and sisters. YOU KNOW, I WOULD BE CONCERNED IF THERE'S NO FRICTION YOU HAVE WITH OTHER DISCIPLES around you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because what is the al what is the alternative to provoking one another to heat, to friction, to a little bit of spiciness? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every now and then. What is the alternative? What does it say? not neglecting to get together. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That word neglect comes from Jesus saying, \"Uh, God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" Abandonment. &gt;&gt; If you're unwilling to speak to your brothers and sisters about things that might spark disagreements, &gt;&gt; you're abandoning them. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; You're neglecting them. You're forsaking them. That's right. &gt;&gt; I say this as a natural conflict avoider. &gt;&gt; That is my natural state of being. &gt;&gt; But I can't be like Jesus and be a conflict avoider. &gt;&gt; No more. No more. &gt;&gt; I I can't work out differences with my wife, with my brothers if I'm a conflict avoider. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, we have to actually provoke one another. It's okay to let sparks fly. It's okay to allow some heat every now and then. &gt;&gt; But the purpose is producing more love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And more good works. &gt;&gt; So don't let sparks fly. Just let him fly. &gt;&gt; I got a I got a bone to pick with you, bro. I'VE BEEN HOLDING THIS IN AND Malik gave me permission. That's not what I mean. That's not That's not what I mean. &gt;&gt; But but okay. Right. So we &gt;&gt; we don't want to abandon each other, right? Okay. SO YOU COULD STILL COME to church on Sunday &gt;&gt; physically be here &gt;&gt; and abandon your family. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Preach it &gt;&gt; because of how you treat one another. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; So you know this passage not neglect meeting one another. I know we talk about coming to me as a body. You could come to all the meetings of the You can see every You can make it a part of your schedule to see every disciple ever every day of your life and still neglect them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And still abandon them. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're unwilling to provoke one another. &gt;&gt; It says to consider one another. I think of the passage in Philippians to consider one another more valuable than yourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I think about that, I think about, you know, you know, getting together. What's the whole point is that one, we need encouragement. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when you think that as people we need encouragement, does your mind think of that's great, who's going to encourage me then? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Or do YOU THINK GREAT, WHO AM I GOING TO ENCOURAGE? &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; You know, you you cannot be a disciple and be a consistent taker. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. Because here's what happens. If we all get together and then some of us agree to be givers and some of us agree to be takers, THAT MEANS SOME OF US ARE giving more than we're receiving. &gt;&gt; We all equally need encouragement. &gt;&gt; And we all equally need to give encouragement. &gt;&gt; We have to be givers in God's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Let's keep going in verse 26. &gt;&gt; All right. Great stuff. Here you go. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. &gt;&gt; It says, \"For if we deliberately go on sinning &gt;&gt; after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire about to consume the adversaries. Anyone who disregard the law of Moses died without mercy based on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment do you think one will deserve who has trampled on the son of God who has regarded as profane the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified &gt;&gt; and who was insulted by the spirit of grace for we now for we know the one who has said vengeance belongs to me I will repay and again the Lord will judge his people. It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands &gt;&gt; of the living God. &gt;&gt; You know this passage is powerful. We all know we cannot deliberately keep on sinning. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, but this part I think sometimes people can people can get caught up on well it says there's no sacrifice for sins left. Does that mean if I if I go back to life of sin I can't come back? That's not the point of what it was saying. Remember how it says that he forgave our sins once for all time? Yes, &gt;&gt; it's referring to your future sins are no longer forgiven. You need to be renewed once again. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; If there's no sacrifice for sins left. &gt;&gt; And I like to think of it as in the book of Revelation where it says that God will take away your lampstand. &gt;&gt; I find what happens is that lampstand could be gone and you may not even realize it. &gt;&gt; Because you're so blinded by your sin. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; So blinded by your disobedience. &gt;&gt; Yep. And we have to be careful as disciples to really understand this. We love one another. We're grateful for the gift of God. But we al must have a healthy fear of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A healthy fear of what he has control over whether we go to heaven or hell based off of our decision making. He says that God rewards everyone based off of what they do, &gt;&gt; what their actions deserve. So, let's make sure to have a healthy fear of God. &gt;&gt; But let's keep reading in verse 32 and we'll close out here. &gt;&gt; It says, \"Remember the earlier days when after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings. Sometimes you were publicly exposed the taunts and afflictions, and at other times you were compions of those who were treated that way. For you sympathize with the prisoners and accepted with joy the confiscation of your possessions because you know that you yourselves have a better and enduring possession. So don't throw away your confidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which has a great reward for you need endurance so that after you have done God's will, you may receive what was promised. For yet in a very little while the coming one will come on and not delay. But my righteous one will live by faith. And if he draws back, I will have no pleasure in him. But we are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and are saved. &gt;&gt; You know, you have to remember where you are going. &gt;&gt; You have to remember who Christ is. You have to remember what he did for you and you have to remember where you are going. &gt;&gt; You know, if you remember the context of all this, the the point of uh Hebrews is this great apostasy. These people leaving the faith who were Jews that converted to Christianity and then they wanted to go back to an Old Testament way of living. And what what is said here in verse 32 which I think we have to come back to consistently is to remember the earlier days. To remember the earlier days though they were struggling, thinking about falling away, thinking about giving up, going back to an old lifestyle, an old way of living, thinking that it would provide security that that it would provide a better hope for them if they can save their bodies. But even if their their souls are crushed, this way of thinking, it says in verse 32, \"What were the earlier days like when they had been enlightened? when they received salvation that they endured hard struggle publicly exposed the taunts and afflictions that there are command companions at least to those who were treated that way to even prisoners for the Lord and that that people would literally the government they would raid their homes and confiscate their possessions and it says that these disciples who right now are considering ing falling away that back then they took that with joy. &gt;&gt; They received these hardships with joy. &gt;&gt; You know, I find another thing if you're struggling and considering the drawback is you have to remember the earlier days. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Remember the the late night Bible studies. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, Bible studies till late in the early in the morning. &gt;&gt; That's right. you know, the persecution, you know, the the hearing STUFF BEING SAID ABOUT you to your face. You know, I had one guy to my face in the Bible say said, \"You'll be seeing me again.\" I was like, \"What's that supposed to mean?\" &gt;&gt; Like here, like at my house like, you know, &gt;&gt; it's kind of it's kind of worrisome, you know? Like, like it's remembering times like that that makes today worth it. &gt;&gt; That all of that was for a reason. and that all we have to do is remember the earlier days and that if we throw away our confidence now it's no use in the trash. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; All of that time, experience, love given, love received, it is of no use to you if it's thrown away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, don't throw it away. And and I if you're struggling right now with drawing back, I want you to know that you can make it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That you can absolutely make it. That every day you have breath, that you can make it. &gt;&gt; That every day that you JUST DECIDE TO GET OUT OF BED, that you can make it. THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO READ YOUR BIBLE, ALL YOU CAN MUSTER IS A SINGLE VERSE. THAT YOU can make it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That you can make it. So let us not draw back, but let us draw nearer still. And to God be the glory.",

    "summary": "This sermon, based on Hebrews 10, challenges listeners to draw near to God rather than drawing back, emphasizing Jesus's singular, perfect sacrifice over Old Testament practices. It contrasts 'worldly sorrow' (self-victimization) with 'godly sorrow' (focus on Jesus), urging transformation and genuine repentance. The speaker highlights three calls to action: draw near to God, hold onto hope, and consider one another by provoking love and good works, even through disagreements. Ultimately, it warns against deliberate sin while encouraging perseverance by remembering past experiences and enduring through faith in God's promises.",

Jesus's single, perfect sacrifice fulfilled God's will and sanctifies believers 'once for all time,' highlighting the inadequacy of old rituals and the complete efficacy of Christ's offering for past, present, and future sins."

Jesus, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at God's right hand, signifying completion and authority. The Holy Spirit testifies to this new covenant where God puts His laws on hearts and minds, and importantly, 'will never again remember their sins and their lawless acts,' removing the need for any further sin offerings."

First, 'let us draw near' to God with a true heart and full assurance of faith, enabled by Jesus's blood. Second, 'let us hold on' to our confession of hope without wavering.

    "transcript": "In Mark 11, I wanted I I I when I was in Atlanta two weeks ago, Colleen spoke at the women's day. Another great example of of good news. 50 sisters had 150 women at their women's day. 158. Those eight souls count. Amen. And then on Sunday, I preached. And so on the flight over, I was finishing the Gospel of Mark and and Mark 11 just really resonated with me and I wanted to preach on it. But then Sunday morning, I read Mark 14 and it's the first chapter of the Passion account and I go, \"Oh no, I can't start the Passion account and leave Jesus hanging right there in the pro. I got to finish the book of Mark.\" So by the time I finished my quiet time Sunday morning, Mark 11 was no longer really relevant to my heart anymore. I was feeling so much more about Mark 14-16. So I come in, no notes, nothing. I go, guys, I'm just going to I'm just going to lay out what's on my heart, bro. &gt;&gt; And uh and it was it prayerfully it encouraged and helped them. And uh but it was the beginning of a lesson I would do for the LA church as well. And I think the context of it is something that is probably something that will help all of us with the things that maybe we're battling with and resonating with at this time. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Mark 11 is the triumphal entry. Jesus comes in and the the city as a whole is worshiping and bringing in Jesus. These are the same people that would ultimately also be led astray to sentence him to death and to be to be flogged and crucified. But Jesus comes into the city and then in verse 12 it say well he makes a whip he he dry or late at night he comes into the temple he's disgusted by what he sees. We know that the next day he ends up making a whip. Everybody likes talk about the f the soft gentle side of Jesus. There's also the whip side of Jesus who literally drove several hundred people out of a room. &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't don't don't don't don't create a god of your mind. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Let your mind be reflective of the God of the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus comes in though and in verse 12 it says, \"On the following day when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.\" Jesus worked up an appetite. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh baby. &gt;&gt; And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs, and he said to it, \"May no one ever eat fruit from you again.\" And his disciples heard it. We know Jesus then goes in, he clears the temple. Then in verse 20, it says, \"As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. And Peter remembered and said to him, \"Rabbi, look, the fig tree that you cursed has withered.\" And Jesus answered, \"Have faith in God. Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, be taken up, thrown into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.\" Therefore, I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it. and it will be yours. And whenever you stand praying, forgive if you have anything against anyone, so that your father who is in heaven may forgive you your sins, your trespasses. &gt;&gt; Wow. This scripture is amazing. Jesus is was but is amazing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; A little confusing sometimes though. They're coming back and he sees a fig tree and he sees lots of leaves on it and he goes to look for fruit and he doesn't find any. But then the text says it was not the season of fruit. Why is Jesus getting upset at a tree for not having fruit when it's not the season for fruit? And then he curses the fig tree. Then the next day they come back and Peter notices that it was withered at the what? The roots. And he says, \"Lord, look the the fig tree you cursed. It's withered. And what is Jesus' response? Have faith in God. Jesus, what does that have to do with what we're talking about? Why is that your response, Lord? And it's his response because it's always the appropriate response. I put before you that everything you will ever go through in life as a disciple is an issue of but one thing, faith. You take someone who is doing good and you take away all the reasons and all the fluff and you boil it down. It's for one reason. They have faith. And you take someone who's struggling, who's going through a hard time and you get rid of the people and the circumstance and the situation. You boil it down. It's one issue, a lack of faith. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Come on. Everything in life as a disciple is nothing more than a faith issue. &gt;&gt; When you're struggling, you know what you really have? You have a faith issue. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; It's all about faith. &gt;&gt; Jesus trained the apostles in so many things. And yet, what is it that they record and hand down to us to have? Have faith in God. All over the scriptures when the disciples were afraid in the storm, what did Jesus say? Why of you of little faith? Why did you doubt? When they couldn't drive out the demon possessed boy of Matthew 11, what they say? Why couldn't we drive it out? What did he say? Because you didn't use the right tactic. Because you didn't go through my ministry training protocol. &gt;&gt; He says, because you have so little faith. &gt;&gt; He says, \"This type only comes out through prayer.\" And Mark 9 says, \"And fast.\" Well, what do prayer and fasting do? They increase your faith. &gt;&gt; Because faith comes from who? Comes from God. Comes from hearing the message. But the message is what? It's the word of God. Fasting augments your faith. You're in a situation where you just don't really have the faith. Fast. God will give you the faith. Pray. God will give you the faith. I want you to just take a second here. Close your eyes with me. Come on. Close your eyes. I can see you. So, if you don't close them, Corey, &gt;&gt; close your eyes. I want you to think about the best moment of your life, aside from your baptism. Amen. Not be religious. We all know that was the best day of our life, but I mean like emotionally, the greatest day. Maybe it was the day you were married. Maybe it was a wedding. Maybe it was the day that you finished college. Whatever it may be, the greatest day of your life. Just think about how you felt that day. Now I want you to think about the worst day of your life. The most miserable you have ever been in your life. Let me ask you a question. On those two days, go ahead and look at me now. On those two days, was God different or was he not the same? So if your faith is in God, your circumstances become irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The people that made you feel the best you've ever felt and the people that made you feel the worst you've ever felt were irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To God. That God is sovereign. God is in control. He makes it happen or he allows it to happen. But at the end of the day, ain't nothing going to happen outside of the will and the power of God. &gt;&gt; And when you have faith in that, then you can move mountains. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; But it's not really you moving the mountain, is it? It says, it says it will be done for you. You don't turn into the Hulk. You don't become Superman. It's God who does it. Amen. But the lesson for us is in the fig tree. Jesus comes to the fig tree and he sees leaves and the Bible says he was expecting fruit even though it was not the season for figs. You have to understand figs. We have any fig majors in the room. Figs have two seasons. Figs have two seasons. They have what's called the breba, which is the early crop, and then they have the tamim or the summer crop. The summer crop is when it produces the figs you think of. They're soft, they're ripe, they're sweet, they're delicious, calorically dense. Don't eat them on a diet. Amen. Those are the summer figs. Those aren't the figs Jesus was looking for. Remember what what time are we around here? We're in the spring. This was the breba. These were the early fruits. So in the early fruits, there was still fruit. It just wasn't the summer figs. They weren't they weren't necessarily sweet. They weren't necessarily as soft. They were still edible. They were still used for cooking. And so Jesus comes and he sees leaves. And even though it's not the the main time, it's still the right time. And he comes in and and he looks and there's no fruit. And this is important for us. Why? Because Jesus was upset because if the fig tree does not produce the breba, it will not produce the telmine. See, a lot of times as disciples, WE GO, \"OH, NO, NO, BRO. I'm just I'm I'm doing this because I'm just not doing well.\" No, YOU'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHO you are. You ever heard the phrase, hey, tell, you know, when a man's alone, that's who he really is. When a woman's alone with her thoughts, that's what she really is. I say when you're weak, that's who you really are in your flesh. &gt;&gt; But often times as disciples go, \"No, no, brother. There's no fruit in my life because of him or her or this or THAT OR SITU.\" NO, THIS IS WHO YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE NOT CLOSE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; And because you're making excuses when the opportunity for true fruit, the summer crop comes, &gt;&gt; come on. There will not be any. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You're just a leapy Christian. &gt;&gt; Second Timothy chapter 3 verse 4 says that there are going to be terrible times. First thing is people will be a lover of themselves. What's the last thing? Having a form of godliness but knowing its power. You look like a Christian. You look like a disciple. When I ask you how you're doing, you say you're good. Well, you're leafy. &gt;&gt; But when we pull the leaves back, where's the fruit? &gt;&gt; You see, leaves, they represent the height because leaves are purposeful. What is the purpose of a leaf? To protect the fruit. That's why you have leaves. It protects the fruit from the sun. What's the purpose of everything we do as disciples? It's to protect us. We have our quiet times to protect our faith, strengthen our faith. &gt;&gt; We We should have quiet times every day. You know why? Because we have a Bible. &gt;&gt; But how about the disciples of the first century? They didn't have a Bible. Well, but they had it in the synagogue. Yeah, but who are the only people reading the Bible in the synagogue? The Pharisees, the teachers of the law. They had to memorize the scriptures. &gt;&gt; So now, if you have the Bible, you don't have a quiet time. That's just worse. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Why do we share our faith? Because we are saved, not to be saved. Why are you here tonight? &gt;&gt; Do you think that this is what you have to do to be saved? Or this is what you do because you are saved? Everything we do as a disciple, see the fruit stems from the root. Remember the second soil, the parable of the sewer. &gt;&gt; What happens to it? It withers because of what? Persecution and trouble. Because of the word. In order for a plant to grow, what two things does it need? It needs water from the soil and what else? Sunlight. What is it that scorches the second soil? The sunlight. The very thing that will grow you will kill you if you are not rooted in God. Root is the natural purpose of one who is planted yes in the word but in God. Jeremiah 17 verse 5-10 says, \"Cursed is the one who trusts in man.\" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He will not see prosperity when it comes. I've heard people say, \"Oh, you know, that guy's not open.\" Let me tell you something. He could have it written on his forehead, I want to get baptized. You'd be like, \"These religious people walking around.\" Do you think you're going to be fruitful because you share your faith? Or are you fruitful because you share your faith? Do you think that your work and your labor is what makes you fruitful? Or do you understand that Jesus says no one comes to the to me except those that the father has granted? &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how we need to share our faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's not why be people become disciples. They become disciples because God softens their heart. He allows them to see the truth. &gt;&gt; So it's not it's not on us to to force them to believe the truth. They can't see the truth unless the father allows them to see the truth. And so right here, Jesus is is helping us understand that it's important to have leaves. The the the the figs will die without them. We need to have leaves. We need to have good habits. We need to have boundaries. We need to have guidelines. We need to have traditions that are rooted in the scriptures. There are things that we do that are good, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they serve a purpose. But if there's no fruit, then you're just religious. Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Because the leaves, they're they're without purpose if there's no fruit. Let's turn over to John 15. &gt;&gt; In John 15:1, Jesus says, \"I am the true vine.\" It's a lot of vines out there. My father is the gardener. Every branch of me that does not bear fruit, he what? Cuts off. But every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes that it may be even more fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. This is something we don't understand as disciples, guys, is that you're saved because of Jesus, not because you share your faith. You share your faith because you're saved. &gt;&gt; You're not saved because you share your faith. &gt;&gt; You come to church because you're saved. You don't come to church to be saved. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; there's nothing you can do to be saved. There's nothing. It doesn't matter how many people you baptize. It doesn't matter how much you give to missions. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; No amount of work will ever save you. &gt;&gt; But here's the thing. If you are saved, you will work as hard as you can. See the difference? See, the religious world, they go, \"Oh, you're saved by grace.\" Yeah, you are. And the fact that you don't live like a disciple is the evidence that you don't have grace. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Grace is not it's not a it's not a coupon you take at your leisure. It's something that's granted to those who have who because they have faith, they repent. And because they obey God in being baptized for the forgiveness of their sins to participate in the death, the burial, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that when they come out, the Bible says they're a new creation. They are clothed with Christ and they receive the Holy Spirit, which is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance to come. Tell me that isn't necessary for salvation. &gt;&gt; Are you saved by baptism? No. That's ridiculous. But you're saved at baptism. &gt;&gt; We're saved by faith. Question is when? &gt;&gt; Colossians 2 says it's our faith that raises us from the water. So we're saved by faith. Question is when? How do you know it's genuine? &gt;&gt; Well, genuine faith is going to produce repentance. And it's a saving faith when you participate in the sacrifice that you're claiming the grace for, which is in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The scriptures could not be more clear. People don't have a hard time accepting the truth because it's tricky. It's because the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. &gt;&gt; But even for us, guys, do we think that we're better than other people because we're part of this church? Do we think we're better than other people because we have the truth? Because right here he says, \"I'm the true vine. My father's the gardener. And if and if you do not produce fruit, he will cut you off.\" Why? Because have you ever seen a vine and his branch? The branch is sometimes 30, 40 feet long. The vine can only support so many branches. So if it can only support four branches and one of them doesn't produce fruit, that's that's 25% of the potential fruit gone. This is why in the church it's so important that as disciples we are all devoted to one another. &gt;&gt; Oh, you might be committed. You might have walked in here, but we can tell when you're not devoted. &gt;&gt; I'll hit on that later. &gt;&gt; But he says that when you're fruitful, he prunes you. Who here can show me the difference between being cut off and being pruned? about right there about an inch. So, if you go up to a vine after it's been dressed or pruned, it'll look like this. And right there, that's it. And then you'll see these cut marks into the vine. That's the difference. Why do you have to prune the branch? Because all those leaves are useless. Now you see the way it works is that the leaves and the fruit grow simultaneously. So the quiet times, the leafy things that we do as disciples, they're necessary. It's important that we're digging into the word. We're having prayers. We're going on double dates for the singles. Amen. We're giving missions. We're getting open about our sins. We share our faith. We make the time to get in studies. I understand we all live different lives, but we're making and we're giving our best. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And as the leaves are growing, the fruit is growing with them and under them. And so you can't really see the fruit of the vine or the branch until you pull the leaves away. See, some of us are so leafy that we're just trying to hide the fact that there's not really any fruit in our lives. &gt;&gt; And this is what Jesus is speaking out against. See, a fruitful branch and an unfruitful branch, they look the same from an outside perspective. But when you peel back the leaves, the fruit's either there or it's not. Question then becomes, what is the fruit? &gt;&gt; Because for so long, what I've heard preached is the fruit is making disciples. And I'm here to say that that is a form of fruitfulness. But that's not really the fruit that we need to be focused on, is it? Think about the parable of the sewer with me if you would. &gt;&gt; Farmer comes to a field, he throws seed, some lands on the path and what happens to it? It gets eaten by the birds. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says that Satan comes and he takes away what was once sown. This is what happens when you come to church. You have de times but you have a hard heart. The scriptures are being sown and they're just bouncing off. And I don't know when, and this is something I've had to learn to be surrendered to. I'm not God &gt;&gt; and I'm not in control. But here's what I know. You come to church week after week after week, but there's a hardness of heart. Maybe not in every area. Maybe one area. Maybe your heart is hard in the area of getting married one day. Maybe your heart is hard in the area of sharing your faith. Maybe it's hard in the area of being open. But there are areas of our hearts that can be hard. And week after week after week, the seed is sown. And at some point, God will say, \"Satan, you can just take that word away. They obviously aren't grateful.\" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, as disciples, the one thing we can prevent is a hard heart. &gt;&gt; What causes a hard heart? &gt;&gt; We talked about in the beginning, what's at the core of bitterness? Doubt. Lack of faith. Lack of faith is one thing. Faithless is another. Doubt. What is doubt? FAITH IS GOD WILL WORK. Doubt is God will not work. James 1 says, \"If you lack wisdom, just ask God. He will give generously to all without finding fault. But there's one condition. When you ask, you must not doubt. Because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed back and forth. That man should not think he will receive anything Lord. He's a double-minded man, unstable in all that he does. The word double-minded is duo psyche, two minds. You got one mind at church and then by Monday morning it's another mind. &gt;&gt; Bible says we got to be singleminded. God is good. &gt;&gt; One person said it. Who said it? There we go. I said God is good &gt;&gt; and all the time. &gt;&gt; Got to edge me here. &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; That's wisdom. &gt;&gt; That's wisdom. God is good. He is sovereign. He works for the good of those of love him who have been called according to his purpose. God is good. It's it's that simple. But the second soil stands for those on the path on the on the rocky place. And the seed begins to to grow, but what happens? It doesn't take root. Doesn't deal with the issues under it &gt;&gt; for whatever reason. So when the thing that would mature it comes, it kills it. The sun is what will mature it. photosynthesis because it doesn't have roots, moisture to keep itself okay. Remember Jeremiah 17, he who trusts in the Lord is like one planted by the stream. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Its leaves are always green and it never fails to bear fruit. &gt;&gt; So God will send the sun because he wants you to grow. &gt;&gt; He wants you to take it to the next level, but it'll kill you. The third soil is the same as the fourth. People don't realize that sometimes the third and the fourth soil are the same soil. The third one is the one that is not tended to or gardened. Same soil. We need discipline. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that the third one becomes what? Choked out &gt;&gt; by less worries, riches, and pleasures. Does not get the moisture, nutrients that it needs. It's important that we excel in every area. Amen. But not at the expense of our relationship with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, it's always funny. Sisters, when they get pregnant, they're so worried about the baby. And Amen. sisters, you should make sure you're careful when you're pregnant. But here's what a lot of women don't understand. That baby is going to get what it needs. You will be the one who is malnourished. You are the one who will suffer. Trust me, God is encoded in your DNA selflessness. If you get pregnant, if if the baby needs this much iron or you need this much iron, but you only got this much, guess what? You're going to be iron deficient. That's the bottom line. &gt;&gt; And so if if you're not doing the best you ever done right now, it's because you're putting your best in something else. &gt;&gt; The question, what is that? It's not it may not even be a bad thing. It could be your family. It could be your work. It could it could be something good. It could even be building the ministry. But here's the point. Here's the point. God expects fruit. But what does the fruit represent? People have said, \"Oh, it means that you're making disciples.\" I think that's a form of fruit. But just think about the the the par the parable for a second. To say that the fruit is making disciples. It's illogical because if I'm the tree and as a as a tree I represent a disciple, then how could my fruit represent a disciple? It doesn't make sense. No, the fruit is my life, my righteousness, my my godliness, my self-denial. And when it falls to the ground and it dies, the se the seed that is in it dies and it becomes a tree that then produces fruit. You you walk you go to an empty field and you plant an apple tree and you come back a year later, 5 years later, 10 years later, it's going to be an apple orchard. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, the fruit in our lives, who's it for? Is the fruit for the tree? No, it's not. The fruit is for others. Now think about this. How many apples does an apple tree produce? 500. How many of those will actually become trees? Maybe a couple. Let's just say maybe we say four, five, maybe one or two%. So then in God's being God, what is a majority of the fruit for? It's for us. What is fruit? It's sustenance. It It takes care of us. It keeps us alive. It sustains us. It's sweet. It's filled with nutrition. An apple has exactly the right amount of fiber for the amount of sugar. It is perfectly made. See the fruit in our lives, guys, who's it supposed to be benefiting the most? Each other. When you see someone discouraged, you go out of your way to encourage them. That's fruit. When we're raising missions and and yeah, I know we probably all have things we'd like to pay. We go, you know what, but let me figure out how to at least help, how to contribute, whatever it may be. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A GREAT QUIET TIME. You're like, I want to encourage someone else with this. &gt;&gt; The fruit is the natural byproduct of being close to God. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT being fruitful. And this is the problem is that too often we can become outcome oriented &gt;&gt; and not input oriented. Let's look at Acts chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; In Acts chapter 2 verse 42. &gt;&gt; See being leafy is going to let people down. Doesn't matter how beautiful those leaves are. If you're hungry, they don't do you any good. &gt;&gt; In verse 42, we know the scripture well, first word, they. That's the church's pronouns right there. They, them. That is the identity of the church. I don't care if you're black, white, Asian, young, old. We are they them. &gt;&gt; There's a oneness of spirit. Latinos. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's a lot more Latinos where I live though in LA. &gt;&gt; The church. This is the level of unity that we have. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's the second word? &gt;&gt; Devoted. You know what? You know what's missing in a lot of ministries &gt;&gt; is devotion. &gt;&gt; You know why your ministry is not quite where it needs to be? It's because you're calling people to be committed, but you're not calling them to be devoted. &gt;&gt; What's the difference between commitment and devotion? I mean, you could be here at church right now and in tons of sin. You're committed. Devotion. Devotion is right here. devotion. You can feel commitment. You can see &gt;&gt; I see you, but I don't know if I feel you. &gt;&gt; Oh, you come to Bible talk. I see you, but I don't I don't really feel you. You ever been there before? &gt;&gt; Raise your hand if you've been there before. Oh, you guys are wicked. I tricked. No, I'm kidding. We've all been there. What? Why are what is it that prevents us from being devoted? We're selfish because we're faithless. &gt;&gt; See, you could be committed and selfish. You're committed because you don't want to go to hell. Now, here's the irony. You may very well still go to hell. I'm not God, so I'm not saying you are. I'm not saying you aren't. But here's what I am saying. Jesus didn't die so that we would be committed to a Wednesday night devotional. He died so that we would be devoted to one another. So that the love that we have for one another, it would supersede racial boundaries. It would supersede age. Guys, do you understand that people go, \"Oh, the nation's divided. The nation's divided.\" THIS IS WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES the brightest. &gt;&gt; It's when times are the darkest. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand that Gen Z is the most believing generation in American history. Do you know that? You go on the university, one in three kids have a cross on. God is working. But we have to be devoted. See, devotion is about input, not outcome. See, a lot of times as disciples, we the things we do, we do it based on what it will produce. We reap because we expect to sow. But righteousness is not about sewing. It's about reaping. You see the farmer, he does not sew generously because he will guaranteed to have a harvest. He doesn't know if he'll guaranteed to have a great harvest. You can't predict the weather. I guarantee this really, really, really, really cold time will probably affect the the the next harvest of something. You can't predict cannot predict the weather. You cannot predict how much it will rain. You cannot predict those things. Sometimes the soil is just not as nutritious as you thought it was. But here's one thing for sure. He who sws little reaps little. &gt;&gt; It's not always that he who sws much reaps much all the time. God's in control. You can share with a thousand people, maybe none of them will become disciples. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, if you share with no people, for sure no one will ever become a disciple. But let's just look at the church and let's ask ourselves, is this an input ministry or is this an outcome ministry? Is this people that are focused on the results or is this people who are focused on righteousness and reverence? It says they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching. Do you understand what that is? That's not the Bible. They didn't have the Bible. The first letter of the New Testament would not be written for 20 years. They had the Old Testament, like I said before. Yeah. In a synagogue where only the Pharisees and the and the the people that were persecuting them would read what they wanted and usually only a verse or two at a time. The apostles teaching was they devoted themselves to following their leaders. Now, their leaders were the apostles. Amen. You go, I have no problem. I just don't trust my leader. You know what? As a leader, you have to embrace that your actions will warrant trust or distrust. &gt;&gt; And you got to own it. Amen. And I know this last year, there have been some people that have warranted distrust. But don't withhold your trust from others who have not warranted that. Cuz guess what? Just 30, 40 days ago, Peter, who they're submitting to, was the same guy that betrayed Jesus three times. They could have focused on that. But they put their faith, their trust in the apostles. They devoted themselves to the apostles teaching &gt;&gt; to the fellowship. &gt;&gt; They devoted themselves to one another, to the breaking of bread. This is what this is what communion really is. The breaking of bread is not, you know, passing the tray on Sunday and taking a little thing. That's okay. &gt;&gt; Paul kind of formalized that to a certain extent to ensure that at a principle we create a tradition that is good. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but you want to know what the breaking of bread is? It's after this is over, brothers, go to Burger King and have a dgroup and talk about how you're doing spiritually. That's the breaking of bread. They talked about what Jesus meant to them, what they were getting out of their quiet times, what they were learning, what they were growing in. It wasn't just church. I'm here to tell you guys that if you're committed to Wednesday and Sunday, that's not good enough. &gt;&gt; You've got to be devoted. It's got to be here. They devoted themselves to prayer. Prayer is not what they did. It's who they were. It's how they responded the good, the bad, and the ugly. We have to be a people of prayer. It's not how we respond. It's who we are in every situation. Look how it keeps going. It says, it says, \"All came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were performed and done through the apostles. The leaders led by example.\" Amen. It says, \"All who believed were together and had everything in common. They sold their possessions and belongings and gave them to anyone as they had need. And day after day they met in the temple courts and broke bread in their homes and received their food with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of here's the hard part, all the people.\" No, you don't get it, bro. I love everybody here except that one brother. You know what the word hatred means in the Greek? Hostility. That's it. You ever walk in the room? Hey bro, you got some hatred in your heart. &gt;&gt; It says they enjoyed the favor of all the people. If there is anyone in this church that does not fall into the all, you got to get open. You got to deal with that. And I understand you're a coward. I've been there, too. No, it's cuz they're not going to listen. Exactly. You're afraid that they're not going to listen. That's going to make feel bad about yourself. You're making it about what? Yourself, &gt;&gt; bro. &gt;&gt; Don't make it about you. &gt;&gt; Make it about them. Do you want to see them in heaven? How you going to feel if you get to heaven and they're not there? &gt;&gt; That's going to suck, right? &gt;&gt; We got to think that way now. We got to encourage one another. That's right. &gt;&gt; We got to make sure that everyone here is devoted to one another. See, look at the last verse. And the Lord, added to their number daily those who were being saved. Do you understand what the Bible is saying? It says in verse 42- 46, they were disciples. They were devoted. They gave their best and God did the rest. &gt;&gt; Here's what I'm trying to say, guys. We need to share our faith. But that's not why people become disciples. We need to have amazing quiet times. But that's not why you do good. You know why you do good? Because God is good. We need to do everything we do so that these things will protect the fruit that's in our lives. Because I'll tell you this, when you come into church and you're not happy, you're not fired up, you're questioning this, you're wondering this, you've got reservations in your heart. &gt;&gt; That stuff's going to rot in you. And at the end of the day, we just need to love each other. &gt;&gt; What is my desire in LA? What is Ro's desire in LA? We want to we want the church to be a place where people feel the godly pressure to love God with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength. &gt;&gt; You should feel that pressure. Jesus died for you. Second Corinthians 5:14 says, \"Christ love compels you.\" That's what it's all about. We have to love one another. That's what it's all about, guys. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it's God who's going to do all the rest. &gt;&gt; So, I want to encourage you. We're all going to have good times, bad times. We got to get rid of the I'm good culture. &gt;&gt; You're not good. Only God is good. &gt;&gt; We also need to create a culture where it's okay to struggle, just not in your faith. Raise your hand if you're struggling. And if you're not putting your hand up, it's cuz you're not trying. Because if you're trying, you should be struggling. Not in every area, but in our area. So can we please be devoted to struggle together? &gt;&gt; Can we be devoted to give our best? Can we be devoted to pour out everything that we have regardless of the outcome? Can we be input oriented that we are righteous for the sake of righteousness, not for the sake OF RESULTS? WE DON'T SHARE FAITH BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL become disciples. We share faith so that they can become disciples. We don't encourage one another because they will take it. We do it so that they can take it. We are not God. We are disciples of Jesus Christ. We have faith in Jesus. And though we will have leaves in our lives, I want to challenge us. Let us have fruit that glorifies the father and to God be the glory.",

    "summary": "This sermon, \"Faithful Fruit,\" emphasizes that true discipleship is fundamentally an issue of faith in God. Using the fig tree in Mark 11 as a central metaphor, the speaker distinguishes between having outward religious 'leaves' (practices and habits) and bearing genuine 'fruit' (godliness, righteousness, and love for others). It asserts that all struggles arise from a lack of faith, and genuine faith fosters devotion, selfless action, and reliance on God for growth and results, rather than focusing on personal outcomes. The ultimate call is to be input-oriented in righteousness, knowing that God will provide the fruit and increase in number.",

        "verse": "Mark 11:12-25",
        "insight": "This passage highlights Jesus cursing a fig tree for having leaves but no fruit, even though it was not the main fig season, because early 'breba' figs were expected. The speaker uses this to illustrate that outward religious practices ('leaves') are insufficient without genuine spiritual 'fruit' (character, love, self-denial). Jesus' subsequent teaching on faith (Mark 11:22-25) directly links fruitfulness to having unwavering faith in God, emphasizing that true spiritual vitality stems from a trusting heart, not just external actions."

        "verse": "John 15:1-3",
        "insight": "Jesus identifies Himself as the true vine and the Father as the gardener, who cuts off unfruitful branches and prunes fruitful ones to bear more fruit. The speaker clarifies that being 'cut off' is due to a lack of fruit (representing a lack of faith), while 'pruning' is a necessary, though sometimes painful, process for already fruitful disciples to grow further. This teaches that spiritual productivity is essential for connection to Christ and that God actively works to cultivate greater fruitfulness in believers."

        "verse": "Acts 2:42-47",
        "insight": "This passage describes the early church's profound 'devotion' to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer. The speaker distinguishes between mere commitment and true devotion, emphasizing that devotion is input-oriented (focused on righteousness and loving God and others) rather than outcome-oriented. The result of this deep devotion and unity was God adding to their number daily, illustrating that when disciples are genuinely devoted, God Himself ensures growth."

      {
        "verse": "James 1:5-8",
        "insight": "This scripture is quoted to highlight the spiritual danger of doubt, stating that one who asks for wisdom from God must not doubt, or they will not receive. The speaker defines doubt as believing 'God will not work,' contrasting it with faith, 'God will work.' This passage underscores that a 'double-minded' person, unstable in all their ways, is hindered in their relationship with God and receiving His blessings, reinforcing the sermon's central theme that everything in discipleship is ultimately a faith issue."

      {
        "verse": "Jeremiah 17:5-10",
        "insight": "This passage contrasts the cursed state of those who trust in man with the blessed state of those who trust in the Lord, comparing them to a tree planted by water whose leaves are always green and never fail to bear fruit. The speaker uses this to teach that genuine, consistent fruitfulness comes from being deeply rooted in God, not from relying on human effort or external circumstances. It reinforces that faith in God provides the spiritual sustenance necessary to remain fruitful and resilient."

    "transcript": "[music] Bible Hebrews chapter 12. &gt;&gt; And no, I will not be preaching totally out of Hebrews. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach a lesson. Amen. God. &gt;&gt; And I really believe God, brothers and sisters, that there are times where we we just need to take a little revamp and talk about things that, you know, we really need for our fellowship, for our family. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 12, starting in verse 28. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Want my pages to fall? &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; This thing is moving down. Huh? Okay. [laughter] I brought my own podium because I was afraid that this little thing is going to be moved up and down. &gt;&gt; But, uh, but this is not my podium. My podium's in my car, but we'll we'll figure that out. Right. &gt;&gt; The Bible says here in Hebrews 12 28, \"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful &gt;&gt; and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe. For our God is a consuming fire.\" &gt;&gt; CONSUMING FIRE. It symbolizes the complete and total destruction of sin, but also THE REFINING power that purifies believers, allowing them to stand in the presence through faith in Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; This concept serves as a warning against sin and urging believers to live holy lives. &gt;&gt; Are you a consuming FIRE THIS MORNING? WHEN I SAY CONSUMING FIRE, are you one of those people WHO ARE PURIFIED, refined by THE FIRE THAT GOD [screaming] GIVES US through his Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, IF YOU ARE A CONSUMING FIRE THE WAY GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE, there is great change in our lives. You know, 2016, a team came here. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; There were a team that was consuming fire. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD GREAT SACRIFICE. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD TO COME UP with monies to get here and plant this church. &gt;&gt; My dear wife and I led the team here. And I'm so proud to see what God has done since 2016. &gt;&gt; But this team WAS BUILT ON LOVE. COMMITMENT, the belief that WE AS ARE ONE and unified as one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That we will not compromise our convictions about what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; We will not compromise our convictions about what true commitment is. &gt;&gt; Are you a consuming fire? Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got two points, but I only may get to one point &gt;&gt; because I'm longwinded. &gt;&gt; So, if I get to it, great. If I don't, understand. &gt;&gt; I My prayer is that my prayer is that I will leave you wanting more. &gt;&gt; Leave you today WANTING MORE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE. That means you need to be the consuming fire, too. Amen. Open your Bibles. Acts chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Point number one. Rekindled love for the fellowship. Rekindled love for the fellowship. In Acts chapter 2, the Bible says in verse 42, you guys know that. You can probably quote it, right? The Bible says they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship and to the breaking of bread and prayer. Everyone was filled with awe and many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold their possessions and to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added their number daily those who were being saved. Just like Leo's getting baptized and Malachi's getting baptized. Amen. TODAY, if you're visiting today, we strive to model ourselves as a church, as the first century church. &gt;&gt; They devoted themselves to the apostle teaching, to the fellowship, and to the breaking of bread, communion. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a sense of togetherness. They said they got together daily. You know, we are family, right? &gt;&gt; So, we're going to talk family this morning. I don't have a lot of time, but I want to talk family. You know, since uh for quite some time, [clears throat] you know, probably just recently, there's been a little bit of a a swerve in this incredible great church. Not everybody, but there's been a little bit of a curve. The commitment level has gone down a little bit. &gt;&gt; But these are for 95% of the churches is on. &gt;&gt; But there's another 5% that is kind of wavered and got away from the first century church commitment. the Bible studies daily, the prayer, the commitments to our services. You know, why are we together? WE COME TOGETHER, GUYS, BECAUSE we need to love God, love each other, encourage each other. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, we're not little ranger disciples. &gt;&gt; WE COME TOGETHER BECAUSE we need each other. We need the encouragement. And without that encouragement, we weaver. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, the world today, they they come here, they don't see ANYTHING LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; WE GOT EVERY NATION, ALMOST every nation represented in this church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You name it. IT'S INCREDIBLE. WE GOT THE WHITE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE BLACK PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE ASIAN PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE INDIAN PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE JAMAICAN PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, YOU NAME IT. WE CAN KEEP GOING. IT'S INCREDIBLE. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WALKED IN the door &gt;&gt; 37 YEARS AGO, &gt;&gt; I SAW SOMETHING just like this and it was amazing. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; LATINOS &gt;&gt; AND THE LATINOS. [screaming] NOWADAYS, THE LATINOS DOMINATE THE EARTH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; NO, BUT IT'S AMAZING, GUYS. And if you're here and you're visiting, you're part of something. You don't even know WHAT YOU'RE PART OF. &gt;&gt; BUT you know, we got to talk about the truth. We got We got to talk about truth. &gt;&gt; See, when some of us splintered off and it lose that commitment, it infects the church. &gt;&gt; You know, midweek nowadays have BECOME OPTIONAL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS CHURCH HAS BEEN BUILT OFF. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THIS CHURCH WAS BUILT OFF people who were committed to every single service. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, church goers are not committed to midweek. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; See, when you're committed TO THE GOD'S CHURCH, YOU COME TO God's church. &gt;&gt; You're there encouraging them. Now, THINGS COME UP WHERE YOU HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, people get sick, you have to go on vacation, things like that. But the Bible TALKS CLEARLY ABOUT, HEY, LET US NOT BE IN THE HABIT OF NOT meeting together. &gt;&gt; If everyone was like you today, what would the church be like? &gt;&gt; You know, there are people at home right now watching this because perhaps they didn't want to get out of bed. &gt;&gt; Perhaps Sunday is optional, too. perhaps, you know, today is a beautiful day. I'm going to go take a nature walk in the park. We hope that that's not the case. &gt;&gt; But I know guys, when I was when CO was around, that was very tough for me to be a part of the fellowship. We were doing these virtual services. &gt;&gt; It was really tough. &gt;&gt; I had open s open heart surgery about four months ago. Cut me open. Quadruple bypass surgery. &gt;&gt; Wow. And I'm standing up on my feet in pain and it's okay. &gt;&gt; I love it's it's part of the process, right, of healing, right? &gt;&gt; And you know, I was in a hospital for 19 days. And it was tough every day not seeing the brothers and sisters on a day-to-day basis. It was difficult. SO WHEN I FINALLY GOT home and uh and I got here and my Bible talk was there and I looked at the circle, &gt;&gt; all I could do is cry &gt;&gt; because I miss the fellowship so much. &gt;&gt; I MISS THE SMILING FACES so much. &gt;&gt; I MISS THE HUGS. And we're a hug church, guys. If you if you know, somebody may if you're busy, someone may be tempted to hug you. Don't think it's weird. It's just, you know, one of those things, right? &gt;&gt; But we we'll try to ease off and just kind of kind of slide in there, give a [laughter] nice little high five, and then we'll get a little high five and then maybe just slide in a little hug. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because we truly love people. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; See guys, Jesus ministry was about love. &gt;&gt; Come on. It was about compassion. &gt;&gt; We have to rekindle the fire for the fellowship. &gt;&gt; You know, there were times when I go TO THE FELLOWSHIP, NOBODY wanted to leave. &gt;&gt; And and you know what? A lot of guys, they don't want to leave. &gt;&gt; Generally, I'd be the last person here because I love the fellowship so much. &gt;&gt; You know, during the sports season, maybe not. Oh, [laughter] &gt;&gt; just kidding. Just kidding. Just kidding. [laughter] &gt;&gt; But you know, I I I I I FIGHT I FIGHT TO STAY HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But since my New Orleans Saints is one and eight, I don't care about that. &gt;&gt; So I I'm not too I'm not too worried about it right now. &gt;&gt; I'm not worried about it right. I'm not worried about it right now. Yes. &gt;&gt; But here's the deal, guys. &gt;&gt; You know, they devoted themselves to prayer. We've got to be a praying church. Amen, guys. &gt;&gt; You know, I love my Bible talk. You know, I love going to Bible talk. You know why? It's not just an incredible food that we serve every Thursday. &gt;&gt; And I know some of you don't serve food in your Bible talks. &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to. But see, if you're anything like Jesus, &gt;&gt; Jesus knew how to get to the heart of people. &gt;&gt; How do you get to the heart of people? You serve food. &gt;&gt; BUT I ALSO LOVE my Bible talk because they love being around each other. &gt;&gt; They love spending time together. &gt;&gt; They love listening to each other encourage each other as the message and the dialogue is going on. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we love the music that starts as they walk in the door. They love the greetings as they walk into the door. They get greeted. They love the hugs &gt;&gt; as they walk into the door. They love the room being lit up with all kinds of bright lights. &gt;&gt; You know, they love that. And then they walk in. As they walk in, they smell the good food. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; See, THAT'S THE GOOD OLD FELLOWSHIP, GUYS. AND THAT'S THE SAME GOOD OLD FELLOWSHIP that we need to have. SEE, IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE JESUS, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PREPARED &gt;&gt; TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE your food ready for service. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ONE OR TWO BIBLE TALKS. &gt;&gt; IT'S EVERY BIBLE TALK LEADER PREPARED WITH FOOD. AMEN. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOUR VISITORS AND YOUR FRIENDS COME, THEN THEY ARE COMING FOR SOMETHING GOOD. IT'S NOT JUST THE FOOD. IT'S THE FELLOWSHIP and it's the word of God. &gt;&gt; See, if you WANT TO BE FRUITFUL, &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO know the basic fundamentals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to have food. &gt;&gt; But you NOT JUST SPIRITUAL FOOD, BUT YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO FEED THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THE ECONOMY IS NOT GOING THAT WELL. SO, I don't know if you WANT TO SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY, &gt;&gt; BUT you know, you know what I'm saying, &gt;&gt; right? We know &gt;&gt; I'm with you, bro. &gt;&gt; They were devoted to the fellowship. Are you a consuming fire? &gt;&gt; Does the fire rain in you when you come to church? Are you enthusiastic? &gt;&gt; Are your smiles bright &gt;&gt; because you just love people? &gt;&gt; See, I smile a lot if you guys don't know. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's not a fake smile. It's a real smile. Amen, guys. &gt;&gt; See, every disciple needs to be smiling. &gt;&gt; Loving God with all your heart. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a potential to fall in this category of not being committed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you're not praying constantly, if you're not reading, if you're falling into impurities of your life, if you're not seeking help, you've got people, resources here. Some of the most talented people are in this group. It's not just the campus students, &gt;&gt; it's those who have graduated, &gt;&gt; those who haven't. But see, anytime someone becomes a disciple, they are just become smarter. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God helps us to be smart. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible helps us to be smart people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I wasn't that smart feminine, &gt;&gt; but the Bible helped me. &gt;&gt; I can nearly pronounce some of the words in the Bible when I start studying the Bible. &gt;&gt; NO, I CAN NEARLY PRONOUNCE them all. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, Acts 4:32:10. The Bible says &gt;&gt; Acts 4:32, \"All the believers were together in one mind and one heart, one mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions were their own, but they shared everything they had.\" With great power, the apostle continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God's grace was so powerfully at work in them all. There were no needy persons among them. From time to time, those who own lands and houses sold them, bought the money from the apostles, from the money from the sales, and put it to the apostles feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need. See, these believers were in one mind and one heart. They gave to any anyone who had need. We are a selfless church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And every member needs to be selfless. What does that mean? That means you remove yourselves out of the equation to meet the need of the other person. Is that your heart this morning? &gt;&gt; Is that your heart when you go to work? &gt;&gt; Is that your heart when you go to the grocery store? Is that your heart when you walk in your neighborhood? &gt;&gt; We got to get back to first century Christianity, guys. Bro, &gt;&gt; not just 95%. But 100%. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you all in? &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. I'm all in. &gt;&gt; Even with open heart surgery, guys, I did not waver. &gt;&gt; I kept going. There were times I had to roll out of the bed just to get to church, &gt;&gt; but I said, \"I'm not going to miss church.\" &gt;&gt; 19 days was long enough for me, &gt;&gt; and I had no choice because I couldn't get up. I couldn't walk. What about you? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Is traveling from house to house traveling to your Bible talk. Is that difficult for you? &gt;&gt; IS IT DIFFICULT when someone gives you a food assignment to bring their Bible talk? It's difficult for you. See guys, when you love the fellowship, when you love your brothers and sisters, nothing is impossible for us to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The first century church had a conviction. They prayed daily. They read. You know, we should be able to walk into our sister churches around the world. &gt;&gt; And we should have the same conviction, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The same standard. What is your standard of fellowship this morning? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Is your standard one that is selective? You only pick and choose the things you want to be committed to. &gt;&gt; Or is it one that says this is what my Bible says? If the Bible says it, I'm going to do it. &gt;&gt; I know, guys, this is basic stuff, but you know, by this time, many of us should be teachers, &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE STILL ON SIMILAC. YOU KNOW, I HAD A brother that I had a brother tell me a couple of weeks ago who's been around. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T EVEN understand communion. &gt;&gt; And he's led people. &gt;&gt; So, I had to go back and teach what communion is. But, you know, it's not his fault. A part of it is. &gt;&gt; Part of it is just We as disciples need to continue to teach our people the basic fundamentals of the truth. &gt;&gt; When I heard this, I was shocked like wow. So you tell me, hey, sometime he even told me sometimes I skip contribution. I mean skip skip communion because you know we have to have communion every day. So I didn't really see my need. It's like whoa. This is a fundamental basic elementary teaching. Then I thought to myself, well, if this powerful guy, young man is struggling with this, what about the rest of the people? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you have problem with understanding command or even contribution? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to I don't want to go on with that. I just wanted to put that out there, guys. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to have our own convictions about what the Bible says. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't wait for your minister or your Bible talk leader to tell you you got to study it all. &gt;&gt; Many claim to be Christians refuse to give up a lie for the truth. Why? Because the acts of the sinful nature are obvious. Galatians chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Some old school preaching, guys. &gt;&gt; Taking it back to the 90s to the 200s. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Second point. I don't know, man. I got a lot here, bro. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. The Bible says in Galatians 5:19, &gt;&gt; I'm going to go here because some of you need it. &gt;&gt; The acts of the flesh are obvious. Sexual morality, impurity, debulry, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambbitious, distinction, orgies, and the like. I warn you as I did before that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. See, sin keeps us away from having a hot fellowship. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; It keeps us a distance away from loving your brothers and sisters. When we live like this, many want to be ON THE FRONT LINE, but they don't want to pay the price and deal with the sin in their lives. I've been there not dealing with the sin in my lives. My biggest sin is has been pride. I've had to fight it over and over and over again. A lot of it was just because I'm an insecure man by nature. My upbringing, it made me insecure. But as I studied THE BIBLE, I PUT MY CONFIDENCE in the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; My confidence is not in circumstances. How much I have, how much I required, my education. It is the Lord only. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because all those things don't matter without a relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter. See, we have got to be men and women who live in the light. Amen. First John chapter one, &gt;&gt; I warn you as I did before that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; First John chapter 1 vers 5. The Bible says &gt;&gt; this is the message we have heard from him and declare to you. God is light. In him there's no darkness at all. &gt;&gt; If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another. And the blood of Jesus's son purifies us from all sin. See, we claim to be Christians but refuse to give up a lie for the truth. You know those hugs, smiling faces. You come in, you smile, you give hugs, but inside deeply there's still sin. roaming in your heart that you didn't confess, you didn't get open, and you haven't dealt with it. The desire to be in the front line, but not giving up impurity, anger, pride, insecurity, and apathy. We've got to be like Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you want to be purified from all sin? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you do, then you need to get open today. &gt;&gt; You need to talk about the deep dark secrets. Everybody has deep dark secrets in their lives at some point in their lives. &gt;&gt; You need to expose those things. Bring it out into the light. Why do you think marriages don't last &gt;&gt; outside of the kingdom of God? &gt;&gt; Because they're deep, dark secrets. &gt;&gt; Why do you think there's a lot of communication between a man and a woman? Because it's not giving your heart 100%. You're giving 50/50. Oh, &gt;&gt; 50/50 is not enough. No, &gt;&gt; you got to give 100%. &gt;&gt; You know, we've got great examples in the church here. People who give their all. &gt;&gt; I I He's one of them. &gt;&gt; But, you know, I wasn't going to go that route because we always go that route with those guys and they deserve it. There's a lot of them. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY WE DON'T TALK ABOUT. YES. &gt;&gt; I'm I want to talk about Marissa. &gt;&gt; Come on, Marissa. &gt;&gt; Marissa. &gt;&gt; Marissa. Now, my wife always corrects me because I want to I want to give her a nickname a new name every time. But Marissa, she's got a baby. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we have this thing called first principles. when we're doing these new Bible studies, &gt;&gt; not new Bible studies, but some there's been some changes in the first principles book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She comes with her baby, at least she was, because she got the okay to stay home and watch it from the video so that she could take care of child. But even though she's not at the first principles, she's watching online and she still takes the test. &gt;&gt; Come on. and she sends it in. But no Bible talk on Thursdays. She brings her baby to Bible talk every Thursday. She does not complain one bit. &gt;&gt; And she is the food planner. &gt;&gt; She plans the good mood food and sends it out. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; She makes absolutely no excuses. And with the baby, she could stay at home on Thursdays, but she chooses to come because she's all in. &gt;&gt; Are you all in? Those who are watching, are you all in? The reason you're not here because you're not all in. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Now, we have older people as we know that have SOME PHYSICAL ISSUES. UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IS JUST AS VIGOROUS AS ABRAHAM, as Moses, and some of the other people. BUT YOU'RE NOT HERE. COME ON. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I want to share with someone else. Daniel, &gt;&gt; Daniel &gt;&gt; and his incredible wife. Let me pronounce that right. &gt;&gt; S. &gt;&gt; They got a little boy. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T MISS MIDWEEK SERVICE. &gt;&gt; THEY BRING THEIR BABY boy and they come and they do the first principles. I watch them and I'm amazed. LIKE THESE GUYS ARE ALL IN. &gt;&gt; What about you? &gt;&gt; What about you watching? Are you all in? &gt;&gt; See, this church was not built on people who are not all in. &gt;&gt; THIS CHURCH WAS built on people who were all in. &gt;&gt; Let me give you a statistic. And Molly, you can help me out. After church, not doing church here, &gt;&gt; we had ABOUT 14 PEOPLE, 16 people on the mission team. Out of that 14, 16 people, we only lost two people. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The other people are still faithful in the Lord. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Who gets the glory? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; It's a testimony of the love in the fellowship. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the testimony. And I told you I was going to try to get this point to, but I don't know. I think I've already went over 20 minutes, but you know, &gt;&gt; two more hours, bro. &gt;&gt; I got one more scripture. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna do one more script. We got two baptisms. That's That's incredible. First John chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I don't think I need to preach anymore. I think I've said enough. &gt;&gt; If I keep going, God's just going to be hot and fiery. But I'm not going to go. I'm not going to You know what? Part of my problem when I get up here is I'm I'm disciplined. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to repent and I'm going to be disciplined. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 John chapter 2 verse 18. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, \"Do not love the world or anything in the world.\" If anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in them. For everything in the world, the lust of flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life comes not from the father, but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever. &gt;&gt; The Bible is very clear. Do not love the world. You know, so don't love the world because those who are in this class, we call them God haters. Whether you think you are or not, &gt;&gt; if anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in you. Do you is your primary friendships in the world or in the in the kingdom? &gt;&gt; You know, there are a lot of business people here who have businesses like we do. But my primary focus is not my business. &gt;&gt; It's not being a millionaire. It's not trying to make money. My primary focus is the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; See, if your primary relationships is the world, you're almost a god hater. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Or you are a god hater, but you don't see it. Sometimes, guys, we got to take a view and take it deep. &gt;&gt; We got to see who we are and what we are in reality when we don't apply the Bible to our lives. You are amazing disciples. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And those who are visiting, I hope you are encouraged. But I hope a fire is lit under you, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if a fire is not lit under you, I'm not doing my job. &gt;&gt; You see, we've got [screaming] Reed. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; And Wesley WHO WANT TO BE SORRY. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. [cheering] [screaming] And Lord willing, THEY'LL GET BAPTIZED IN a couple weeks, &gt;&gt; IF NOT SOONER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE GOT LEONARDO WHO'S GETTING BAPTIZED TODAY. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A FIRE. [screaming] OH, I'M SORRY. SORRY. Forgive me. Leo, &gt;&gt; he doesn't like that. Don't call him Leonardo. Call him Leo. Amen. I just love Leonardo so much, but Leo. Leo. All right. YOU'VE GOT MALACHI GETTING BAPTIZED TODAY. WHY MALACHI GETTING BAPTIZED? BECAUSE THERE'S A FIRE lit under him. HE SEES THE TRUTH. HE UNDERSTANDS the truth.

You see, you got to rekindle the fire for the fellowship. You got to love God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul. &gt;&gt; If you're visiting today, get with the person who invited you. Find out what this is about. The chances are you going to find anything like this. I know when I walked in, I'm like, \"Man, this is this is insane. I've never heard somebody preach the word and lay me out from the the the the the pulpit or the the seats here. They just flat out laid me out, called me out, they told me everything. They knew my life without even talking to me. &gt;&gt; And that's what it was like for me. I'm like, whoa, DID SOMEBODY TELL THEM ABOUT ME? WHOA, DUDE. BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS FELLOWSHIP IS LIKE. AND THAT'S WHAT THE FELLOWSHIP and our sisters of church sisters churches are all about. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you preach the truth unapologetically, God moves in a powerful way &gt;&gt; in the hearts of people. &gt;&gt; To God be the glory. [music] &gt;&gt; [music]",

    "transcript": "[music] Let's go to Hebrews chapter nine. You know, today we'll only do one chapter. Not not not as not as much just be like yes a silent a silent yes for that. [clears throat] Uh but today we'll do one chapter and really uh today's chapter uh in Hebrews uh is REALLY UH A setup for the next few chapters. A lot of this chapter is context. A lot of this chapter is pretty much just Old Testament stuff. Um, but but if you're feeling like maybe you're falling a little out of it, if you could just give like a little like a hoof just to like, you know, get yourself back into it. If you feel like I'm if you think I'm losing you, if it's too much explaining and it's it's too much Old Testament, just let me know. Just say something and then I'm sure we'll all be encouraged by that. &gt;&gt; Um, but it'll be fun. But Hebrews chapter 9 and verse one, the Bible reads, \"Now the first covenant also had regulations for ministry and its earthly sanctuary. For a tabernacle was set up, and in the first room, which is called the holy place, were the lampstand, the table, and the presentation loaves. Uh behind the second curtain was a tent called the most holy place. It had the gold altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered with gold on all sides in which was a gold jar containing the mana. Aaron's staff that budded and the tablets of the covenant the cherubam of glory were above the ark overshadowing the mercy seat. It is not possible to speak about these things in detail right now. With these things prepared like this, the priests enter the first room repeatedly performing their ministry. But the high priest alone enters the second room and he does that only once a year and never without blood which he offers for himself and for the sins of for the sins of people committed in ignorance. The Holy Spirit was making it clear that they that the way into the most holy place had not yet been disclosed while the first tabernacle was still standing. This is a symbol for the present time during it during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the worshippers's conscience. There are physical regulations and only deal with food, drink and various washings imposed until the time of the new order. Our title for us today is simply salvation to those who wait. Salvation to those who wait. Our first point is we have waited for clean consciences. &gt;&gt; We have waited for clean consciences. You know, like I said, a lot of this we'll talk about the Old Testament. You know, it even gives uh a little bit of a of a of context talking about the the tent, how they had priests and they're doing their priestly duties day in and day out, but only one man, the high priest, could enter basically another curtain within the tent and that was the holiest of holies. That where the ark of the covenant was. Inside the ark of the covenant, there was the tablets that God gave Moses, Aaron's staff that budded to prove his leadership. Uh there was a gold jar containing mana, the very first mana that they had. And all of this really is all just a symbol. All of this is just preparation for what the author is soon to talk about. But I want to talk about verse one for a sec. how it says now the first covenant also had regulations for ministry and an earthly sanctuary. You know if you have an NIV the word also won't be there but in the Greek that word is actually there. The word is kai and it's there in other translations. It'll say also it'll say even with the you know old covenant there was this and this idea that though there was of course in the old covenant regulations that even in the new covenant there are regulations. In the old covenant there were priestly duties. Same way in the new covenant but the question is how? And the question is why? And the two things it focuses on is regulations for ministry right priestly duties serving the Lord at the tabernacle. And the second thing is the sanctuary itself, the the tabernacle itself, which of course, you know, we refer to now as heaven, but not just heaven, even the kingdom, the sanctuary here on earth, right? Um, and verse 8, it actually gives the the reason behind all of this. It says that the Holy Spirit is making it clear that the way into the most holy place had not yet been disclosed while the first tabernacle was still standing. that simply all of that happened then was a foreshadow and we talked about it last time with Joseph with David with Moses that all of them are simply foreshadows of Christ that is to come and it's even honing in here on the tabernacle itself and that the new covenant cannot come to be unless the old covenant the old way of doing things specifically the old tabernacle is all gone. It all has to be gone. So the new cannot be established until the old is completely done away with. But like I said, this is actually very literal. It's really hard to, you know, read a passage like this and you ask yourself, well, how does this apply to me? You know, like I go to work, I have my job. What does this mean for me? Well, to be honest, this is all context that not a whole lot of this is quite applicable just yet. But I want you to think about putting ourselves in the Lord's shoes for a moment and how that for hundreds of years this was all simply a foreshadow. Meaning that God intentionally waited. He intentionally waited to start his kingdom. He intentionally waited to bring Jesus. He intentionally waited to bring this new covenant. It wasn't like Genesis chapter 1, Jesus is on earth, you know, or starting with Moses, you know, we have Jesus coming right away, right? Like the kingdom is here with the very first covenant. There's a specific reason that God literally waited over hundreds and hundreds of years to establish this new covenants, you know, and I think even, you know, to this day, you know, maybe that we we can feel before being a Christian like, you know, if only like I I knew God's word from birth, you know, if if you've seen the Matrix, you know how they they download like karate into their minds, you know, or maybe they they could download like you know physics you know be being as smart as like you know Isaac Newton into their minds like maybe we just part of us hopes that like if only I knew disciplehip from the get-go you know if only if only a part of me like just from the beginning I'm learning like if I just knew what to do from when I started all of this would be so much easier but but God he waited he was the first one to patiently wait [snorts] and you know I I find that it's once again it's all for a reason even for us today there's a reason why we don't just instantly know God's word and it says in verse 9 of chapter 9 that all of that is a symbol that what it was a symbol for the present time and specifically so that we could understand what to do today so that we could understand how to live today how to serve God today think of it this way imagine going to school and your professor let's say you're a physics professor wanted to teach you physics but never gave you a textbook that that everything you had to learn was straight from his mouth. There's no textbook. There's no document. Imagine how hard it would be to learn physics. &gt;&gt; Be awful. You know who here has maybe math as like a weakness? That's kind of me. Okay. So, imagine trying to learn like calculus or statistics with zero textbook only what the teacher says. &gt;&gt; Horrible. THAT THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE, RIGHT? WELL, WHAT that's the point of the old covenant that that literally there's actually something to build off of. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A way to understand, wait, we can be defiled. Oh, wait. Like, there are ways that God doesn't like, you know, what we do, right? Like, I can look at the Old Testament and see, wow, God has regulations. God has a way of life that he wants us to live. That literally it's all there for a purpose. And maybe it's simple to think that if it wasn't there, it'd be more helpful. But actually, it'd be a lot harder. &gt;&gt; It would be way harder to understand God, understand his word. So, the Old Testament one is extremely necessary. &gt;&gt; We need it. And more so, we need to read it, right? We have quiet times on it. Even if it means, you know, you could go from reading uh five chapters or four chapters of New Testament a day, but if you go to Old Testament, it's fine to slow it down. Maybe take take one or two chapters a day, right? is but take your time. But the Old Testament is is necessary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's necessary to read. &gt;&gt; But one thing that it also says is the Old Testament, it cannot cleanse your conscience. &gt;&gt; It cannot perfect your conscience. So, so even though it's necessary to know in and of itself, it was never God's final way. It it was never the end of it all that that Jesus came to, it literally says establish a new order, a new way of living. Let's go to Mark chapter 7. &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 7 &gt;&gt; in verse 14. &gt;&gt; It says, \"Summon the crowd again.\" He told them, \"Listen to me. All of you, and understand, nothing that goes into a person from outside can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.\" When he went into uh the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable. He said to them, \"Are you also as lacking in understanding? Don't you realize that nothing going into a person from the outside can defile him? For it doesn't go into his heart, but into the stomach and is eliminated.\" Thus, he declared all foods clean. And he said, \"What comes out of a person is what defiles him.\" From within, out of people's hearts come evil thoughts, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders, adulteries, greed, evil actions, deceit, selfindulgence, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness. All these evil things come from within and defile a person. You know, it is the things that we do, the sins that we commit, and even the thoughts that we have that really defile us. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And really, all that we do is a product of our own hearts. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; All that we choose to do, all that we, you know, set our minds to do is a product of what we already are on the inside. And I find you know of course the context of Hebrews is these people um Jewish Christians who Jewish well Jewish people who convert to Christianity they are struggling with going back to the old covenant going back to Jewish law. And that's the context for them. You know that the Old Testament is is not worth it. The Old Testament is is never meant to help you. It's not supposed to actually clean your conscience. And even though I don't know if any of us here specifically have left, you know, Judaism to come into Christianity, but I find that maybe we have a quote unquote old covenant way of thinking. &gt;&gt; Specifically in thinking that if only, you know, I had this in my life that I would actually be holy. I would be pure. Maybe if it was if I had a different mentor, I would be more righteous. Wow. &gt;&gt; Maybe if you know um if maybe it's me. Maybe it's if someone had better preaching on Sundays, I would be more holy. You know, like, &gt;&gt; you know, maybe maybe it's something. Maybe it's, you know, if only I had I heard this new self-help book that just came out recently. If only I had that, I would be more disciplined. &gt;&gt; I I [laughter] I would be more, you know, selfless, you know? If only I had this. If only I had that. If only I could do this. But really, it's who you are from the inside that changes the outside. &gt;&gt; But what happens is we adopt this old covenant way of thinking of thinking. No, no. It's it's what's on the outside that changes the inside. If only this can change. This person was in my life. If I had this, if I had that, you know, maybe it's kindness. Maybe I'm only struggling with patience because my finances aren't so good. So if God gave me more money, &gt;&gt; I would be a patient person. &gt;&gt; That's not how it works. It is actually what comes out of your heart that defiles you. &gt;&gt; Not your outside circumstances, not the things happening around you. And I find what happens is maybe we, you know, go back to a way of thinking that Jesus literally came to replace like he came to establish this new order that the that that was an old way of thinking and it was never meant to clean your conscience. And I find that really what it is is why do we do that? Why do we think outside sources can fix our heart? is because ultimately every human soul longs for Christ. Every human soul longs for God. &gt;&gt; And there's different ways that we do it in a wrong way out of dissatisfaction, out of discontent. You know, I find that some people turn to religions that are pretty heavy on, you know, physical regulations, right? what you eat, what you drink, what time you pray, what you wear. And they're pretty heavy on that. Why is because you're you're thinking this is what will make me righteous. Or maybe it's not about choosing a religion other than Christ, but maybe it's going after substances, going after relationships, hoping that these would fill the longing in your hearts. And there's different forms of pleasure. There's different forms of, you know, having your high. Maybe your high isn't just from, you know, uh, sex or from drugs, but maybe your high is from greed. See, seeking after having more, obtaining more, seeking after finding the one person that can tell you all that you really are, even though God is telling you all who you're supposed to be. And &gt;&gt; and we're looking for some form of it to fill that longing in our hearts. And really that constant longing, that constant yearning, that constant searching for more, but even though you don't really know what it is that you're looking for, what you're really feeling is that loss of freedom. And in those moments, you realize it of that I I am a slave to everything but God. And so really what happens is kind of a conundrum that when you serve Christ and you serve God, that is how you are free. Christ is the only one that could actually free you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so this realization, this longing for more and more is really the realization that you've lost your freedom. &gt;&gt; And what you need to do is go to Christ. &gt;&gt; What you need to fill that longing for is Christ's. You [snorts] know, only Christ is the one who's able to grant freedom for your soul. And there's no satisfaction other than Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Colossians chapter 2. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 2 &gt;&gt; it says in verse 20 if you died with Christ to the elements of this world why do you live as if you still belong to the world why do you submit to regulations don't handle don't taste don't touch all these regulations ations refer to what is destined to perish by being used up. They are human commands and doctrines. Although these have a reputation for wisdom, by promoting selfmade religion, [snorts] false humility, and severe treatment of the body, they are not of any value in curbing selfindulgence. [snorts] You know, the point is that if you've died with Christ and Christ has truly freed you, that you no longer are trying to please your flesh. You are no longer giving into self-indulgence. And so, you have to let your your soul be aware of Christ. You know, the word conscience, it it comes from uh the the Greek word to see. And so, but conscious the word is a noun. So, it's literally the noun version of to see, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. What is the noun version of looking, right? But, but the idea is that it's your soul. Your soul is in a state of being that is focused on Christ &gt;&gt; that that is constantly aware of Christ. And specifically it says to uh to see completely that's what it means conscience to see completely to to the degree of which you can distinguish good and evil and typically and obviously choose what is good and condemning what is evil. [snorts] And so we want to let our sk our souls actually be aware of Christ. We want to feed our souls Christ. And so it is not your physical practices that determine your spirituality. It is your spirituality that determines your physical practices. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a reason why we devote ourselves to the fellowship. There's a reason why you see in the book of Acts right after they're converted immediately. How does it describe the relationship with God? The relationship with the other disciples was devotion out of gratitude, out of love. And it's not enough just to do acts of devotion. it is to be devoted &gt;&gt; from an inward level. And you know, I find that typically when you're struggling being devoted from a heart level, from a conscience level, and maybe you're working towards doing acts of devotion, from things that you think will make you righteous. If I come to church, I'll be righteous. If I take notes, I'll be righteous. If I have my weekly discipling times, I'll be righteous if I take communion. But you're not actually thinking of it coming from your heart. you're only focused on the acts of devotion. &gt;&gt; I find that there's typically something that hasn't died yet. &gt;&gt; There's something left to be crucified &gt;&gt; because that's what the passage SAYS THAT IF YOU HAVE DIED WITH CHRIST, if you have died, then you have to also put away the elementary teachings. &gt;&gt; So if the elementary teachings are coming back up, you're trying to have a holy, righteous life based off the things that you do. There's something that hasn't died yet. there's something that you have still yet to crucify. &gt;&gt; And I find it's not just that you know it you never crucified it from the moment you died, but it's that you're you're you're you're digging back up dead bones. &gt;&gt; You're you're you're you're you're taking down what Jesus meant to nail on the cross, and it was there, but you're saying, \"No, no, no. I don't I don't like that scenery. How about you come on down? That's not what you're supposed to do. Last time I remember the person in the Bible that rebuked Jesus for dying on the cross, he was rebuked by Jesus himself. &gt;&gt; When you don't allow something to be nailed on the cross, Jesus disavows that. &gt;&gt; You have to nail it to the cross. &gt;&gt; You have to keep it dead. You can't raise it back up. So, let's go back to Hebrews chapter 9. And if you're struggling with that today, if you're struggling with digging back up old bones, &gt;&gt; if you're struggling with doing simply acts of devotion rather than being devoted from a heart level, &gt;&gt; my simple, you know, encouragement to you is bring it into the light. &gt;&gt; Even if you don't know what, EVEN IF YOU'RE UNDECIDED, I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT to continue. I don't know if I want to be devoted. Just simply bring it to the lights. &gt;&gt; And specifically, bring it to somebody that you know that that loves you so much that they're willing to let it get a little bit uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; That that loves you so much that that they want to tell you exactly what you need to hear, EVEN IF IT HURTS YOUR FEELINGS a little bit. &gt;&gt; Because what matters most is putting it all to death so we can be totally freed and we can serve God. So back in Hebrews chapter 9 in verse 11 says, \"But Christ has appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come in the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is not of this creation. He entered the most holy place once for all time, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkling those who are defiled uh sanctify for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to God cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we can serve the living God. [snorts] you know, Christ is the the perfect sacrifice. And you know, in the old covenant way, you know, what what would happen when they started the uh the tabernacle and the covenant, we'll talk about this more later, is that literally, it talks about sprinkling the people with blood. That's literally what they would do. Like imagine the the covenant was instated and I wanted to make sure all the people were holy. It would have I would have the blood lamb and I would have we'll talk about it later but instruments to cleanse the people. Imagine if I just went around with like blood, a pigeon, a little piece of flour and some wood and started like going like that to everybody you know and maybe it won't hit everybody. Maybe because like the front row people, maybe Kevin gets hits more, [laughter] you know, you know, but maybe maybe like Chris is spared, you know, it doesn't get far enough, but like he's technically like hit by the blood, you know, but Kevin kind of just takes the the brunt of it. But that that's literally what they would do, right? And so but but it says through Christ that it's not through the constant repetition of these blood sacrifices but through his singular sacrifice &gt;&gt; that we are cleansed and specifically our conscience are are cleansed so that we can serve the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It all has a purpose so that we can serve God. And when our consciences are cleansed what does that really mean? is that we can see the world for what it truly is. That that that we can understand light and darkness, good and evil. We have discernment. And we've been purified not by our actions, but by our desire, our will to be close to God. And so therefore, we see everything as what it is. You know, you you you know when you know, times are hard, but you understand what you should do. And it's not given to sin. It's not giving to discouragement. It's not giving to self-indulgence. It's giving into Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And giving into him. Let's go to point number two. &gt;&gt; It's simply we wait for Jesus. We wait for Jesus. [snorts] And in verse 15, the Bible reads, \"Therefore, he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. Because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant, where a will exist, the death of the one who made it must be established.\" Excuse me. For a will is valid only when people die, since it is never in effect while the one who made it is still living. That is why even the first covenant was inaugurated with blood. For when every command had been proclaimed by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats along with water, scarlet wool, and hop and sprinkled the scroll itself and all the people, saying, \"This is the blood of the covenant that God has ordained for you.\" In the same way he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the articles of worship with blood according to the law almost everything is purified with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. You know the passage here says that Jesus is the mediator of the new covenant [snorts] and that the covenant is like a will. It doesn't come into effect until the one who is in charge of it dies. you know, my possessions don't just get passed to people just because I made a will and then now you guys start taking all my stuff. No, &gt;&gt; I would have to die first, you know, for for my stuff to belong to other people. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And you know, we see this I think in two main different ways, right? Jesus, he came proclaiming that the kingdom is near, right? So even though he came, prophecies are being fulfilled simply by his coming that the kingdom didn't come just by his arrival [snorts] that that it was a later on event that happened actually specifically after he died. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um and the other thing was the authority to forgive sins &gt;&gt; that Jesus would go around and he would forgive people's sins. And you know nowadays we can't just walk around with people saying your sins are forgiven. you know, you're, you know, you're healed and whatnot, but now there's a new covenant way of doing that happens specifically after he died, [snorts] &gt;&gt; you know, and people even point to this. People they they talk about, well, Jesus forgave the sins of the thief on the cross and then he forgave the sins of the paralytic on the mat on the mat, right? But simply, how could he do that? But yet today, there's a different way of saving people is because he hadn't died yet, &gt;&gt; right? It literally says in verse 17, for a will is valid only when people die. Says it is never in effect while the one who made it is still living. So Jesus, you know, obviously he made the covenant of repentance for the forgiveness of sins and being born again through water baptism, but that's not in effect until after he dies. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And so if anyone obviously they refer to these different things of you don't have to really repent, you don't have to really get baptized. And they referred to a gospel passage. Just show them this scripture. Say, \"Hey, look it. He didn't die yet.\" So, he was able to do that. In fact, that was meant to happen. But now that he's dead, the will is in effect. &gt;&gt; We have to repent. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have to get baptized. We have to be disciples. &gt;&gt; Um, but the other question is why blood? Why blood? Why is it blood? You know, and because blood, you know, the shedding of blood, that kind of sounds gruesome, you know, like why would God make, you know, the shedding of blood be the act that actually forgives sins? Well, let's go to Leviticus chapter 17. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Sounds like you guys want a Leviticus series. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Leviticus 17 in verse 10 &gt;&gt; it says anyone from the house of Israel or from the aliens who reside among you among them who eats any blood I will turn against that person who eats blood and cut him off from his people for the life of a creature is in the blood and I have appointed it to you to make atonement on the altar for your lives since it is the lifeblood that makes atonements. You know, this passage is interesting because Jesus now Jesus God gives two reasons why why blood essentially why we don't eat blood in the in the old covenant and why it's so important. And one says that it is the lifeblood of all creatures. You know, when you see blood, you don't think about, you know, that person is doing really healthy. And I know the music's really loud and uh you know I'm going to say a little prayer hopefully that uh music goes down. God please help them to be more conscious of the people around them &gt;&gt; and that and then even if they don't that we can still focus on your words in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; And um you know the the the blood if you if you see blood you think of a loss of life. If I saw blood on the sidewalk here, I wouldn't think, \"Oh, someone's healthy. &gt;&gt; Someone's really thriving around here, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING SO GREAT. They're living it out somewhere.\" No. If I saw blood, I'm like, \"Someone's life is being lost. The loss of blood equals the loss of life.\" So, literally, God chose blood for a very logical reason. But then there's actually a second reason why he says blood. Says, \"Cuz I said so. That's the second reason &gt;&gt; I find that's pretty much all of God's commandments. There's a very reasonable reason. There's something that makes sense and you connect the dots. You know, there's a history to it. Maybe there's physics behind it. There's some sort of mental thing that happens or whatever it is. But then there's another reason which is just because God said so. &gt;&gt; And I find that both are pretty equal in my eyes, right? Some people need a reason and some people is just because of God said so &gt;&gt; and they're both there. Amen. So why blood? Because God said so. And then there's also a reason because it's a symbol of life. Let's go back to Hebrew chapter 9. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And uh we'll we'll close out with these last few verses. It says, \"Therefore, it it was necessary for the copies of these thing of the things in the heavens to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these. For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands, only a model of the true one, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God for us. He did not do this to offer himself many times as a high priest enters the sanctuary yearly with the blood of another. Otherwise, he would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared one time at the end of the ages for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for people to die once and after this judgment, so also Christ having been offered once to bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to bear sin but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him. you know, taking this chapter as a whole, like I said, there's it talks a lot about the old covenant, the old way of doing things, and it gives a lot of context, but overall, the the message of this chapter is, if I could break it down, is clean your conscience and then wait for Christ. &gt;&gt; Clean your conscience and wait for Christ. And you know, it's pretty hard to endure, to endure trials, to endure challenges, to endure pressure where God is refining you, making you stronger, making you more holy. It's pretty hard to endure all those things if your conscience isn't clean. &gt;&gt; And that's why it's so important. &gt;&gt; And you know, we think constantly, you know, like you think of, you know, what am I waiting for? We think of urgency. What can I do? Let me do it now. But also, we should think about who are we waiting for. You know, are we waiting? Who are we waiting for? Are who we waiting to fulfill the longing that we have? Who are we waiting to, you know, come into our lives the the fix all our issues? And the question is, is it Christ or is it someone else? &gt;&gt; You know, who are you waiting to free you from yourself? Is it someone to give you a good word? OR IS IT YOURSELF? IS IT CHRIST? &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; You know who you waiting to take you home. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Take you to the place where God has a room waiting for you. And that person should be Christ. And I I think in [snorts] greater context just for today's day and age, you know, there is such a greater capacity now more than ever for distractions. &gt;&gt; The the world is literally at your fingertips, literally. in your cell phones, on your laptops, like it's everywhere. It's like there's a new app every day where people can put their opinions out on the internet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like literally like it's it's just like the world is just becoming more and more easy access. &gt;&gt; People's thoughts, people's evil thoughts, people's evil actions &gt;&gt; are literally becoming more and more accessible to today's society. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I think what we have to do is be more focused on Christ more than ever. &gt;&gt; If every day the battle is getting harder, then every day we have to get more focused. &gt;&gt; It's not enough to be focused now and have the same level of focus a month from now, &gt;&gt; a year from now. Is you have to be more focused &gt;&gt; CUZ SATAN HAS TACTICS TOO. HE'S LEARNING ways and and the once you get comfortable and you're focused that is when opportune time comes &gt;&gt; we have to get more focused &gt;&gt; now more than ever and at the end of the day why because there's no solution other than Christ we have to be more focused on Christ because there is no way to be free other than through him and through him of course there's no greater purpose there's no greater fulfillment there's no greater persecution, right? But there's also no greater joy. &gt;&gt; There's no greater peace than through Christ. So, I think what we need to do is simply get rid of all the distractions. Get rid of all the noise. &gt;&gt; Anything that your soul longs for that you know isn't Christ because he's going to keep anything that's not Christ will keep leaving that hole empty. So, we have to get rid of all the distractions, &gt;&gt; everything that's trying to fill that hole. And what do we do then? We have to, of course, as it says, be devoted, be devoted to one another, to his word, to to communion, to to prayer, right? And how do we do that is we have to literally rearrange our lives. Like Christ has to be the priority of our lives. He has to be the focus of our lives. But then also have a good example to show others. &gt;&gt; Like if you don't have a life that you know you want to live, how can others want to have the life that you want to live? &gt;&gt; You know, we we have to be focused on Christ. But more importantly, I I think we we can't just be focused on doing acts of devotion. We have to be devoted from an inward level, from a heart level. And I find that if you can be devoted at an inward level, at a heart level, have your consciences cleared and cleaned as you're seeking first Christ, then when you wait for Christ, you won't find yourself disappointed because you had waited eagerly for him because you set your hearts on him. So let's wait for Christ and let's clean our conscience. To God be the glory. &gt;&gt; [music] [music]",

    "summary": "This sermon, titled \"Salvation For Those Who Wait,\" focuses on Hebrews 9, emphasizing the contrast between the Old and New Covenants. The Old Covenant's regulations and sacrifices, though necessary context, were a foreshadowing and could not truly cleanse the conscience, as defilement stems from within the heart. Jesus, as the mediator of the New Covenant, established salvation through his singular blood sacrifice, providing eternal redemption and the ability to serve God with a clean conscience. The sermon exhorts believers to crucify self-indulgence, overcome distractions, and cultivate an inward devotion to Christ while eagerly waiting for his second coming.",

        "insight": "The speaker explains this passage details the Old Covenant's earthly tabernacle, its rooms (Holy Place and Most Holy Place), and the priestly rituals, emphasizing the high priest's limited, annual access to the Most Holy Place with blood. This entire system is presented as a symbolic foreshadowing, a temporary arrangement where the Holy Spirit made it clear that the ultimate way to God was not yet disclosed, and these sacrifices could not perfect the worshipper's conscience."

        "verse": "Mark 7:14-23",
        "insight": "This passage is used by the speaker to highlight Jesus' teaching that defilement comes from inside a person's heart through evil thoughts and actions, not from external things like food. This contrasts with the Old Covenant's focus on external regulations and is presented as a crucial shift in understanding what truly makes a person unholy, moving beyond outward practices to the condition of the heart."

        "insight": "The speaker references this section to challenge believers who have died with Christ to no longer live according to worldly regulations, self-made religion, or severe bodily treatment. These external practices, while appearing wise, are ultimately of no value in curbing self-indulgence, emphasizing that true freedom and purity come from an inward focus on Christ, not outward adherence to rules."

        "insight": "This verse is cited to explain the profound significance of blood in God's plan for atonement in the Old Covenant. The speaker notes two primary reasons: first, blood represents life itself, symbolizing the ultimate cost of sin; and second, because God explicitly commanded it, underscoring that some divine directives have both logical reasoning and are simply to be obeyed because God said so."

His singular sacrifice cleanses believers' consciences from 'dead works,' enabling them to serve the living God.

    "transcript": "in in Hebrews chapter 7, &gt;&gt; you know, it's we I we finally hit the the critical turning point here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Many chapters we have referenced, slightly spoke about this man named Melzdc. &gt;&gt; And today is the day that we'll finally really talk about him. Hebrews chapter 7 in verse one says, \"For this mazesc, king of Salem, priest of God most high, met Abraham and blessed him as he returned from defeating the kings. And Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First his name means king of righteousness then also king of Salem meaning king of peace without father, mother or genealogy having neither beginning of days nor end of life but resembling the son of God. He remains a priest forever. Our our title today is simply the greatness of Christ. &gt;&gt; The greatness of Christ. And now we're we're finally talking about it. But we're finally talking about who is this MelzDC? Well, let's just gather some information first. So, what does the passage here clearly say about him? One, that Melzdc blessed Abraham. And we'll turn there later. We'll turn to Genesis. But from this passage alone, he blessed Abraham. It says Melzdc was without father, mother, or genealogy. It says neither beginning of days nor end of life. So this man was mysterious. &gt;&gt; No one knows where he comes from and no one know where he went, just some guy, right? Um and but but we know that he's not just some random mysterious guy with no purpose, no meaning. That everyone everything in the word has a meaning, right? Uh of course it says that his name is Melzdc, king of Salem. Well, Melzdc, if you split it in half, it's two words. Malech, which means king, and zedc, which means righteousness. So his his his name literally means king of righteousness. But then he's also king of Salem. Salem literally means peace. So the phrase Melzdc, king of Salem, literally means king of righteousness, king of peace. That's that is what that's what his name literally means. And he was there at the time of Abraham or at specifically when Abraham was called Abram 600 years before Moses when he instituted uh Levites in the Levitical law and Levitical priesthood. So 600 years prior. But let's go there real quick. Let's go to Genesis chapter 14. &gt;&gt; Let's gather some more information on Mazdc. Genesis 14 in verse 17. So at this time there was this briefly there is this war and Lot uh Abraham's cousin Lot was in the middle of this war. He wasn't a partaker of it but he was kind of caught in the crossfire. He was taken captive. Abraham finds out and he goes to try and rescue them and he does. And so this is right after he uh rescues Lot. says in verse 17, Abra after Abram returned from defeating uh Chedolmer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Sheba Valley, that is the king's valley. Mechazedc, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine. He was a priest to God most high. He blessed him. It said,\"Abram is blessed by God most high, creator of heaven and earth, and blessed be God most high and who has handed over your enemies to you. And Abraham gave him a tenth of everything.\" So here there's two main things that Melzdc did. One is he brought to Abram bread and wine, which if obviously as a Christian that should ring some flex, you know, like, \"Oh, that's interesting. Bread and wine.\" I would think of communion, right? Uh secondly is that he blessed Abraham. It says that Melkazedc blessed him. And what did what did Abraham do? It says that Abraham gives this priest who is a man. He is priest of God most high. He gives him a tenth of his plunder. A tenth of what he took from you know conquering the other kings, right? And I I want us to go back to the context of Hebrews and that there is this apostasy where people are falling away turning back to Judaism or at least this temptation that is uh common amongst disciples in the church who were Jewish converts and they wanted to fall back to their previous faith. But the father of their previous faith, the father of Judaism is Abraham. Moses might have written the law and done the law, but they don't consider Moses the father of Judaism. They consider Abraham the father of Judaism. And yet here he is taking communion with this guy. Here here he is literally being blessed by this other guy. And yet you would you would think like, well, this is the father of my faith. But he himself in this moment was being sonsed by another man. And so it really gets you to think of who's superior here, who's the one in charge? Who's the one that's greater? And to a point where Abraham tithes to Melazdc. He gives a tenth. He tithes to this man. So let's go back. Let's go back to Hebrews 7. In Hebrews 7 and verse4 it says, \"Now consider how great this man was. Even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the plunder to him. The sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have a command according to the law to collect a tenth from the people that is from their brothers and sisters. Though they have also descended from Abraham, but one without this lineage collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. Without a doubt, the inferior is blessed by the superior. In the one case, men will uh men who will die receive a tenth. But in other case, scripture testifies that he lives. And in a sense, Levi himself who receives a tenth has paid a tenth through Abraham. For he was still within his ancestor when Melzdc met him. Okay. The first thing it says in verse four is to consider how great this man was. Consider how great this Melzdc is from. It says that from tithing to him, from being blessed by Melzdc, that Melzdc proves his superiority. Whoever this man is, we're still trying to put the pieces together. But what we can see is that this MelzDC is superior to Abraham. He is greater than Abraham. And he proves his superiority by not only being greater than Abraham, but being greater than the Mosaic law. being greater than the Old Testament, specifically the law that was given through Moses because it even says that you know the one who gave later who wrote the law technically gave to Melzdc while still being in his ancestor but he but Melzdc himself this is the only time he actually appears in scripture. His name is referenced in other parts but this is the only time you actually physically see him in this there's literally three verses and that's it. There's no there's no other place. But th this is not just about MKZDC. This whole concept, why is the author of Hebrews really honing in on basically like a theme of most of his book on this Melzdc figure? Why is he talking about this man who was considered a priest of God most high but was never of the order of Aaron? You know, this is about something far greater than just Melazdc. something far greater than this man who appears for just three verses. You know, consider how in the beginning of the Bible in Genesis, God says he refers to himself in a plural manner. Let us make man in our image. That from the very beginning, you can actually see Jesus. That is not just God the Father alone, but he himself is plural. &gt;&gt; He is one but multiple. And that you see literally from the first chapter of the Bible, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And then a few verses after, let us make man in our image, he says, \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" &gt;&gt; And that is not just about God and his plurality, but about God and his people. &gt;&gt; That that God wants his people to be on earth. And what it is, it's Jesus and the kingdom from the very beginning, from the very start. This is all everything has been about Jesus and his kingdom. Let's let's take for example Joseph. Joseph, who was he? The the the biggest thing that people attest to him as a flaw was boasting to his brothers. But he stated a dream that he had that God revealed to him &gt;&gt; as a matter of fact. And he states this dream. He has basic he has uh even because his sons were brought up um in his place as sons of Jacob, he has technically 12 brothers and he's betrayed by Judah and Judah in Hebrew is Judas. So out of his 12 brothers, one of his brothers betray him though he's an innocent man. So he suffers an in and goes to prison for something he didn't do. He did no wrong. But then after being humbled, he is raised out of prison and put as the second position in all of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh, which is you would think is as resemblance a symbol of God the father. And but he's in charge of everything. He's in charge of Pharaoh's household. Jesus has authority in heaven and on earth. And literally, it's all a symbol of Jesus, &gt;&gt; his whole life. You have, for example, you have Moses, right? It says that in Hebrew in Hebrews we'll read later that he didn't consider the wealth of Egypt as something to be taken but chose to be one of of course his his brothers the Hebrews the Israelites right and he left the wealth of Egypt to be with his brothers and sisters &gt;&gt; and then he goes and redeems them from slavery it's Jesus like like literally it we could point to different not obviously not everyone has flaws Moses had his flaws, right? But the idea is that you see throughout people, throughout stories, throughout characters, this image of Jesus throughout the whole Bible. &gt;&gt; You see it in David. You see it in Solomon. Uh Gideon was mentioned earlier. You you see it in Joshua. You see it in Hezekiah. It is this image of Jesus literally from the very first chapter of the book of the Bible to the very end. Jesus and his kingdom, his people. And and this focus on Hezekiah is bringing to light something far greater far greater this thing that that we're a part of. And you know this concept of seeing uh Jesus and his people, let's take it further, right? The beginning of Genesis, you see this example, this plurality of God and God wanting a nation for himself. At the very end of Genesis, what is is Joseph's final words. He says two final statements. His first statement was he says, \"Do not consider or take to heart the evil you did against me because God used it for good for the salvation of many people.\" That was Jesus's sacrifice. And then the very next thing he says was, \"Now go and take over the promised land promised to Abraham.\" And then it's the great commission like it is almost like a a resemblance of the book of acts &gt;&gt; like it is this great not just parallel but it's a singular representation &gt;&gt; of God's character &gt;&gt; in God's nature &gt;&gt; and you know there are these these things that we see and you you when you look deep you're like that's Christ's you look more deep that's also Christ like like all like wow like it's almost like from from the beginning, God is trying to point us to Christ &gt;&gt; from the beginning of from the beginning of time. And you know, it's not just the words of Christ, but the Bible is is the word. The Bible is Christ. &gt;&gt; That that he is the word that he has always been with God from the beginning. So, of course, from the beginning of the word, you will see Christ because he has been with God since the beginning. John chapter one, like it all it all ties together. &gt;&gt; It's all about Jesus. and his kingdom. All of it, &gt;&gt; every every last part of it &gt;&gt; from the beginning of time. To prove it further, let's go to Acts 28. &gt;&gt; Acts 28, &gt;&gt; the very end. So once again, consider the parallels. Actually, Acts, if you if you're not considering the Gospels, is the only story in the New Testament where it's more in a story format. And I want you to maybe in the future uh consider the parallels to the book of Acts to the book of Genesis. And there's many um and what's fascinating is you have even the parallels of the beginning of the book of Acts and the end of book of Acts similar to the beginning of the book of Genesis to the end. Here's what it says. The last verses of Acts 28 verse 30 says Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house. And he welcomed all who visited him proclaiming these two things proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance. &gt;&gt; This is the whole point. This is what it's all about. He's like, \"What is my focus? What is my message? What is what? I use the Bible. I use the word. But they didn't have the New Testament. They had the Old Testament. And they used the entirety of the Old Testament to talk about Jesus and his kingdom &gt;&gt; because it's all throughout it. It's everywhere. And you see it through thousands of years, through moments of history, you know, through the the people's uh the lives of those who lived at this time. and and dare I say Jesus shines through the lives of those who live today as well. This message of Christ and his kingdom that he is literally the center point of human history that he is what this all revolves around everything everything from our beginning. And if you don't see that, and worse off, if you don't believe that, it's time to wake up. &gt;&gt; You know, they're struggling with going back. They're struggling with apostasy, falling away. And then the message about Melzdc, this mysterious figure, is don't you see the greatness of God? &gt;&gt; You're thinking about falling away. You're thinking about giving up. You're thinking of another route that you can have to godliness. you're missing the points. &gt;&gt; You're not seeing how great God truly is, &gt;&gt; how great Christ is. &gt;&gt; And so, what is it uh this this passage about? What is MKZDC about? It's time to wake up before it's too late. Simply put, point number one is Jesus is king and priests. Jesus is king and priests. So, why MelzDC? Why is Melzdc the focus here compared to the other examples that that could be brought up, right? And you know, at this time, if you were considering apostasy, um you know, specifically these uh Jewish converts to Christianity, if you were considering apostasy where Abraham is the father of your religion, you have to consider who blessed Abraham. And it wasn't just God. There is there was another figure who literally blessed Abraham. So you think he's the father of your religion, but he was soned by another figure. So who was that figure? Who is Melzdc? And I think it's time for us too that if you're considering no longer being a disciple, consider your alternatives. &gt;&gt; Co consider the alternate route that you could take. Whether it's wanting to live it up in sin, live living it up in pleasures. I think sometimes as disciples you can struggle with that. But maybe it's not specifically that. Maybe it's wanting to live a double life. &gt;&gt; Being half in and half out. &gt;&gt; You're one way in front of people in front of disciples. You're another way in front of your friends at work, your family at home, your childhood friends. And you're like, \"Maybe I could try and do both. &gt;&gt; Maybe I can have a purpose when I'm at church and a purpose when I'm not at church.\" You know, maybe your alternative is, you know, you want to continue, but you would rather harbor hatred. &gt;&gt; You'd rather harbor unforgiveness, harbor, you know, bitterness. And and you're you're not moving forward. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Uh maybe it's just simply you just want to give up. You're tired of sharing. You're tired of coming to church. You're tired of, you know, being being discipled on things. You don't want to be discipled. You're tired of giving discipling. Maybe you're tired of being of being a disciple. You're like, I just want my own time. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're considering the alternatives right now. And the point of mazes is simply put is that any alternative is not better. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There there is no there is no better alternative. That Christ is superior. Christ predates all your alternatives. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He He's been around long before any other solution that you could have to a godly life. And it is proven through MKZDC. It is proven through Genesis. It is proven through everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Any solution that you might have to a good life, Christ predates that. &gt;&gt; And if you're considering them, consider how inferior it is. &gt;&gt; How inferior it is. If you want a life of peace and godliness and love, but you're trying an alternate route, I guarantee you it is inferior. Christ is the superior solution to love and peace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're wanting to have a life of integrity and maybe you read a lot of self-help books, &gt;&gt; Christ is superior. &gt;&gt; Christ is better. &gt;&gt; If if if you're considering, you know, like trying to put on a facade, look like you're truly worshiping in front of others and maybe it looks good, but it's all on the outside, but you're not cleaning the cup on the inside. &gt;&gt; Christ is superior. He predates all of your solutions to look good and to feel good in a godly manner. &gt;&gt; Christ is the superior option &gt;&gt; to whatever you would rather do. Anything. Pick one. If you think of, well, maybe not. Surely not this one. Surely that one. That one included. But let's go back to Hebrews. Hebrews 7 &gt;&gt; in verse 11. It says, \"Now if perfection came through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, uh what further need was there for another priest to appear said to be according to the order of MZDC and not according to the order of Aaron? For when there is a change of pre of the priesthood, there must be a change of law as well. For the one these things are spoken about belonged to a different tribe. No one from it has served at the altar. Now it is evident that our Lord came from Judah and Moses said nothing about this tribe concerning priests. Okay. So it's talking about this interesting relation between the priesthood of Melzdc and the priesthood of Aaron. Right? And in verse 12 it says where there is a change of priesthood there's a change of law. MelzDC is the OG priest &gt;&gt; there. There was a priest of God most high before Aaron &gt;&gt; before the Levitical law. And so even if you're like, well, I want to go I want to go back to tradition. I want to go back to the old way of living for God. It's like, well, if you're going to go back, to be honest, Melzdc is the the true origin of the priesthood that well, they're they're the change in law. Meaning that when we had the Levitical law that it changed from the original, there was a priest of God most high. He was king of Salem. That was a king in the land of Canaan. And Salem was actually Jerusalem. And so this man was a priest to this nation that was a gentile nation. He was uncircumcised. He did not receive the Abrahamic covenant of circumcision. So this man was a priest to the Gentiles before. That means there was a priest to the Gentiles before there was a priest to the Jews. &gt;&gt; That was the that was God's original plan. And you see it evident in the scriptures &gt;&gt; that that God had this original plan of that there was actually a priesthood. the whole planet &gt;&gt; and it was before Aaron &gt;&gt; before the Mosaic law. So where there's a change of law is not just referring to the Mosaic law to Jesus but actually if there's a change of priesthood there's a change of law it's actually saying from Melzdc to the Mosaic lawc is the OG law the OG priesthood. So actually going back, yeah, Christ predates your law. &gt;&gt; You want to go back to Judaism, but Christ is actually the the OG priest. &gt;&gt; That the order of MKZDC is the actual original way, &gt;&gt; the way God intended. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading. In verse 15, it says, and this becomes clearer. uh if another priest like mec appears who did not become priest based on a legal regulation about a physical descent but based on the power of an indestructible life for it has been testified you are a priest forever according to the order of mazdc so the previous command is anulled because it was weak and improfitable for the law perfected nothing but a better hope is introduced through which we draw near to God so Jesus is comparing him of course to Melzdc right he has no beginning of life uh no end of days and and Jesus who is he right he is excuse me he is eternal he has he has no beginning he's always been there no mazec has no end of days Christ when he was murdered he was killed he rose from the dead he can't be killed so Jesus is like this mazdc figure no beginning and no ends right and It it is talking about how the law uh specifically blesses you, the law uh couldn't perfect anything, right? And that word perfect is the same word you see in other passages of completion. &gt;&gt; The law the law couldn't complete you. And the idea was going back to this concept of MelzDC was the OG priest. Then in the middle ground was the law and now we're back at Jesus that the law was more so like a bridge. It it was more it was like a middle point but the bridge is not the destination &gt;&gt; and in fact it was maybe needed to get to the destination but Jesus as the final sacrifice he was the final one to cross that bridge. There is no need for the law. &gt;&gt; There is no need for this middle ground. It it was never meant to perfect you. It was always the middle point. There was the original and then there is the perfected. There is Melzdc and then there is Jesus. The law was never meant to perfect us. &gt;&gt; It was it was never meant to be the the the ending point. It was literally the connection. &gt;&gt; It was it was the bridge. And then we keep reading in verse 20. It says, \"Now, sorry.\" None of this happened without an oath. For others became priests without an oath, but he became a priest with an oath made by the one who said to him, \"The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind. You are priest forever.\" Because of this oath, Jesus also be also uh become the guarantee of a better covenant. Now many have become Levitical priests since they are prevented by death from remaining in office. But because he remains forever, he holds his priesthood permanently. Therefore, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him since he always lives to intercede for them. For this is the kind of high priest we need. Holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. He doesn't need to offer sacrifices every day as high priest do. First for their own sins, then for those of the people. He did this once for all time when he offered himself. For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak. But the promise of the oath which came after the law appoints a son who has been perfected forever. You know Jesus is our our king and priest. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? He is our ruler, our commander, our lord. He is our king. Just like mec was a king and a priest. Priest. Well, what does that mean? He is our atoner. He is the one that does the sacrifice for our sins. Verse 25 says he is able to save completely completely those who come to God through him. &gt;&gt; Since he always a as he lives eternally in heaven always interceds for us. &gt;&gt; Awesome. &gt;&gt; And you know m maybe at times I know I can struggle with this. Maybe at times you're like me where you want to have your cake and eat it too. &gt;&gt; Where you want to get to God, but I I really appreciate Rob's communion. &gt;&gt; I relate to that immensely of bringing your old self into your current walk with God. &gt;&gt; And then maybe even thinking it could come with you to heaven. that maybe it's it's okay if I continue. It's it's not as bad as this other brother and their pride, their selfishness, their sin. It's definitely not as bad as the world. So, I must be pretty good. And you you make excuses for the sins in your life. And you know what happens is you're you're trying to get to God while maybe even doing the minimum minimum amount of commitment, minimum amount of devotion, minimum amount of love for other people. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're even thinking, how can I be discipled doing the minimum amount of sharing? &gt;&gt; How can I be a disciple be doing the minimum amount of discipling? What is the bare minimum I could do? And instead of obeying Jesus's will, God's will, it's your will, but you're trying to get God to sign it. &gt;&gt; Just put your signature on there, God. Endorse my plan here. Tell me my plan is good. I I think it'll work to get to you. And what it is is you're is trying to live a life of disciplehip, but flying under the radar. Well, what is the minimum I can do to be unnoticed and not called out for my for my hypocrisy? What is the minimum amount that I could do to not be called out for my resentments, for my lack of love, for my lack of commitment to Jesus Christ? What is the bare minimum I could do? And the reality is that you're trying to trick others, but in that you trick yourself. Cuz when you hear the word, but don't obey it, you deceive yourself. &gt;&gt; You try to trick others, &gt;&gt; but really you fool yourself. &gt;&gt; But who you're not fooling is God. That's right, man. &gt;&gt; He's the one who was like, \"I'm watching everything, bro. Like, &gt;&gt; sis, I'm seeing all this. Like, you're not you're not flying under the radar. You're you're being pinged on the radar. I see it all. The alarms are going off. Like, it's noticeable. You know, it's it's evident. And you you you would fool yourself to think that you can come to me while not going through the gates. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the gate. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Jesus is everything, you know. Um, you have to get to God through Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what the passage says. &gt;&gt; You have to get to God through Christ. If you're not doing it through Christ, it is impossible to get to God. &gt;&gt; It is impossible. You are not the standard. No other person is the standard. &gt;&gt; There is no other measurement but Christ. &gt;&gt; He is the only way to get to God. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. And because of that, it says that he's able to save you completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thoroughly, holy, that that you can actually truly be complete through Christ. So don't compare yourself to others. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't try to do the bare minimum. How can I fly under the radar? Be a notice. How can I keep myself from being discipled because I don't like people telling me what to do. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. Preach that. Don't don't try to, you know, keep yourself while at the same time saying, \"I'm being Christlike.\" &gt;&gt; Get to God through Christ. &gt;&gt; Simply follow the king. That's that's the that's the practical for you today. &gt;&gt; Follow the king. &gt;&gt; Uh it says in verse 26, he is holy. The king is innocent. Our priest, he's undefiled. He is separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens. He is everything we want to be. Like I I hear innocent and I'm like I deeply desire to have my innocence. &gt;&gt; I deeply desire to stand before Christ and say I did all that I could. &gt;&gt; I wanted to be undefiled, separated from sinners, holy set apart for your purpose, Lord. I lived for that. &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading in verse one of chapter eight. Now, the main point of what being said is this. Okay, so now we're at the main point. We haven't we haven't even we haven't even really we we we're now we're here, guys. We arrived. Okay, now the main point of what being said is this. We have this kind of high priest who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not man. For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, it was necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. Now, if he were on earth, he wouldn't be a priest since there are those offering the gifts prescribed by the law. These serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things as Moses was warned when he's about to complete the tabernacle. For God said, \"Be careful that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.\" But Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry. And to that degree, he is the mediator of a better covenant which is which has been established on better promises. So now we're here. Now we're at the main point. What is the main point? I honestly I kind of already said it, but Jesus is the point of everything. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He He is the center of all this. &gt;&gt; That it says before this that he is the sacrifice. He is the high priest making the sacrifice. But then it also says he's the tabernacle. He's the place where the sacrifice is done. So he is the lamb, the innocent lamb that is brought as a sacrifice. He is the priest that is bringing the lamb. But he's also the place to where the priest is even bringing the lamb in the first place. &gt;&gt; He's all of it. And we could actually go deeper on this concept. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He is the altar. &gt;&gt; He is the ark of the covenant. That he is actually the curtain that separates the rest of the temple between the ark. Right? He's the curtain that he is the the priestly robes that we have to clothe oursel with Christ. It literally goes on &gt;&gt; that that what is the point of everything then when you read the the Bible and all of history all of time of God speaking to his people and the examples the the instruction that he told them to build all of this is all Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All of it. &gt;&gt; That's the main point. Come on. &gt;&gt; The the main point that is Jesus. And once again, in the beginning, John chapter one, in the beginning was the word. The word was God. The word was with God. And he was, so now it's he. He was with God in the beginning. &gt;&gt; So everything points back to Jesus. &gt;&gt; What is this passage saying? Jesus is the best priest. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the best mediator, the best sacrifice. that Jesus is the the He has the best covenants. &gt;&gt; He has the best promises. &gt;&gt; He's the best. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the best. That's &gt;&gt; and I can logically prove it to you. &gt;&gt; I I I can prove it to you with history, prove it to you with facts that you cannot refute it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's the best. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the best. Meaning there are no other alternatives. There there there is no other thing you could do. There is no other solution that if you're thinking of maybe a better way to have peace in your life by all your troubles being taken away and all your sorrows are gone and all your problems are gone and that everyone in your life just listens to you and obeys you and that everything is good. That's not Jesus is the best peace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That comes from righteousness. Not that. He is the best form of integrity &gt;&gt; that he is the best form of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There there is no the the the wisdom of God is foolish to Christ. &gt;&gt; Like it it is like like literally people speaking philosophy is like goooo gaga to God. &gt;&gt; You're like oh that's cute. You know like like that's Jesus is the best. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's better. He's superior. He's greater. That's Jesus. He is the best. And so Christ is superior to any other way you want to achieve godliness. &gt;&gt; But the thing is no one is stopping you. &gt;&gt; Not a single person is stopping you. If you're sitting here today and you're considering the alternatives of maybe there is no one is stopping you. &gt;&gt; No one will stop you. And if actually if someone tries to stop you from giving into a life of sin, let me know. No one is stopping you. You are you are free to do as you please. If Jesus is Lord, worship him. If anything else is, do that. Worship that. The don't be unwavering. Don't be don't waver between two opinions. Don't be double-minded and unstable in all you do. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on, brother. It &gt;&gt; It's time to pick a side. &gt;&gt; There is Christ aside and there is everything else. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it. Pick a side. It's time to pick a side &gt;&gt; right now before you leave this room. And if you're undecided, pull someone to the side. pick a side today. &gt;&gt; Worship Christ or choose an alternative. &gt;&gt; But I guarantee you Jesus is best. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He is He is the better option. He is the superior solution. Like that that is who Christ is. And I can prove it to you factually. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's how great Christ is. And whatever you choose to do, as for me and anyone else who chooses to stay here, this household, &gt;&gt; we will worship the Lord. Let's keep reading. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 8:7 it says, \"For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second one. But finding fault with his people,\" he says, \"See, the days are coming, says the Lord. But I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. I showed the I showed no concern for them, says the Lord, because they did not continue in my covenants. For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws into their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people. And each person will not teach his fellow citizens and each and each his brother or sister, saying, \"Know the Lord.\" because they will all know me from the least to the greatest of them and I will forgive them their wrongdoing and I will never remember their sins. &gt;&gt; By saying a new covenant he has declared the first obsolete and what is obsolete and growing old is about to pass away. You know we we've entered something incredible here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're we're a part of something so great. And what it is, it's the new covenant. &gt;&gt; We're we're a part of this new covenant. &gt;&gt; What is the new covenant? It it says in this new covenant, the the law of the Lord is written on our minds &gt;&gt; and it's on our hearts. &gt;&gt; It says that in this new covenant, God who created the heavens and the earth is our God and we are his people. It says that there will be no need to teach. There's no need to command each other, tell one another, hey, you have to know the Lord because those who want to know the Lord will be here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not saying we're not students. Jesus created disciplehip. He he he created he he created the best being students, right? &gt;&gt; So, it's not saying there's no need to teach one another literally. &gt;&gt; But there's no need to make one another &gt;&gt; cuz we will all do it. Because only people who want to do it will be here. &gt;&gt; That's the point. &gt;&gt; It says in this new covenant, he forgives us all of our sins. Says he remembers them no more. That the things that we're ashamed of, the things we hate, the things we don't want to be vulnerable about, God takes it. It's like, look at you. You're you're trying to get to God through me. You you're you're coming you're coming to me through Christ. Why do I need to reflect on your past? Look at who you are now. Doing your best being wholehearted. &gt;&gt; It says the old has passed away. You know, we talked about it briefly uh in Ezekiel how the destruction of the temple in 70 AD. There is no more Judaism. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's been around 2,000 years. They have not rebuilt the temple. They haven't built it on the spot. Actually, the spot where there should be a temple is that crazy enough is a mosque. &gt;&gt; And that's it. There's no more Judaism. We are now in the new covenants. And if you are coming to God through Christ, meaning you are a baptized disciple, you are committed to a life of repentance and you are devoted to his kingdom. You are on the right side of history. &gt;&gt; You are literally within the border, the kingdom which all of time and all of history is centered around. that when when all of this fades away that you will be taken on to glory. When all of this is gone and and and truly one day your troubles will be gone. &gt;&gt; So he will wipe away all your tears and when that day comes you will be with God. That when his army comes of 20,000 that you would have surrendered everything to him &gt;&gt; being on his side. That's &gt;&gt; right. being found at peace &gt;&gt; and that here we are. Church is not an event we do on Sundays. &gt;&gt; The the the kingdom is not just something we commit ourselves to four days a week &gt;&gt; an hour and a half a day. &gt;&gt; It is everything. &gt;&gt; The kingdom is everything. &gt;&gt; There's nothing greater. All All of this is centered around Jesus and his kingdom. That's right. And I hope if you take anything from today, it is to realize the greatness of Christ. &gt;&gt; And to God be all the glory.",

    "transcript": "Let's go to Hebrews chapter 5. &gt;&gt; My title for us today is is simply the focus is Jesus. &gt;&gt; The focus is Jesus. And that is every Sunday. Amen. Um but you know we've been going through the book of Hebrews seeing the context. We know of the persecution that is happening at this time because of uh emperor Nero and you know the call literally in every chapter is to go back and focus on Jesus. &gt;&gt; If you're struggling with maybe ah maybe there's another route maybe I could worship a different way. the the like I said previously, the book of Hebrews is for you. Um so we're going to pick up from where we left off in Hebrews chapter 5 in verse one. It says, \"For every high priest taken from among men is appointed in matters pertaining to God for the people to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray since he is also clothed with weakness. Because of this, he must make an offering for his own sins as well as for the people. No one takes this honor on himself. Instead, a person's called by God just as Aaron was. Okay? So, you know, this the first part of it, it is referencing the Old Testament. It's referencing uh uh the high priests in the Levitical Covenant. And I do think that to really have a a deep love and knowledge of the fullness of Christ requires for every Christian, every disciple to seek to understand the old covenants. &gt;&gt; And it's it's almost as if, you know, my my my wife and I, we dated, we actually dated for three months before I proposed to her. Um, and you got to work fast, ladies and gentlemen. But when imagine that we're we're we're dating and she and to to get to know her, she starts to talk about key moments of her past. She's like, \"Baby, you know, we're here. We're on, you know, we're talking. I I would love to talk to you about, you know, the the school I went to. I have a degree in musical theater.\" And imagine, you know, I'm sitting there. I'm like, \"Okay, &gt;&gt; okay. It's part of your pass, I guess. you know, imagine she goes into, you know, more of her young younger childhood is like, \"Yeah, actually, you could probably tell by, you know, the skin tone, but those are my adopted. They adopted me. My parents adopted me.\" Like, yes, adopted. I guess people are adopted all the time. &gt;&gt; Or imagine if she says, \"You know what? My family's in this part of New York, but I was actually born in a hospital in the Bronx. And the Bronx? The Knicks are in Bronx. Do you know about the Knicks? &gt;&gt; Do you do you watch? And imagine if like like now like a trigger word like happens. And I totally am not giving any attention to what she's talking about, but now like trying to see if like she's fascinated the same thing I'm fascinated with. I think we can do that with God quite often, &gt;&gt; you know? those like high priests, you know, Levitical Covenant. Like I'm not that's not interesting. Jesus, I can do that. I love the New Testament, you know, that's gets me excited, you know, but but but God wants is inviting us to know the fullness of him. So, we're not we're just going to go I'm glad Hebrews covers a little bit of the old law and whatnot, but I I would really urge everyone seeking a relationship with Christ to go after understanding the old covenants &gt;&gt; as with any relationship. And uh Jesus right here is being compared to the high priest and even references Aaron which was the first high priest under uh the Levitical law. And it says uh three key things about the high priest. It says first the high priest is able to deal gently with those going astray because of their own weakness. His own weakness. Why? Because he also was human. He also would sin. And so he could relate to those who are coming to the temple to have sacrifices for their sins because he himself has weaknesses. He himself sins. The other thing about a high priest in Levitical Covenant is that he would make an offering for himself, right? Because of his own weaknesses. And the third thing is that a high priest cannot choose to honor himself to that position. He has chosen you. You don't you do not elect yourself to be a high priest. And if we take all these things considering, let's read the next few verses in verse 5 says in the same way. So now Jesus is being likened to the high priest in those three things specifically. In the same way Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest but God who said to him you are my son today I have become your father also also says in another place you are a priest forever according to the order of Mazdc. During his earthly life he ordered prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his reverence. Although he was the son, he learned obedience from what he suffered. After he was perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him. And he was declared by God a high priest according to the order of MZDC. You know, we we've seen this a few different times, the order of MZDC, but we're we're still not going to get into it this lesson. Uh it's really not until a few chapters later. But the first thing it focuses on was that Christ didn't exalt himself, &gt;&gt; right? In fact, he actually did the opposite. He left heaven. He left riches. He left his his his his already position there to come down and have a completely human form for our sakes. &gt;&gt; You know, point number one is the source of salvation. The source of salvation. But the question I find that many people can struggle with and can stumble over is why? Why would Jesus have a complete human form? And sometimes it could even be confusing at times. You know, how is it that he is human in every single way? And and why does God though he is in the flesh, why is he not immediately exalted? How does he come? And he is still God, but he has to basically get himself to a position of being exalted by God himself, by God the Father. And and it says here specifically that he has to have his human likeness so that he can atone for our sins. &gt;&gt; It's necessary. It has to happen this way. and and Jesus wasn't instantly exalted, let's say, the moment he was born, or else the story would have ended there. There would have been no need for the rest of the gospels. And Jesus didn't come to earth as a fully formed man. No, no. He had to have his ministry. He had to disciple his people. He had to have teachings. He had to face persecution. He had to die on the cross. All these different things he actually did for our sake. And he did it to prove himself to you. He did it to prove himself to all of us. Why? In what specific way? To show us what it means to be heard by God because of our reverence. &gt;&gt; He set the example of reverence. If if he wasn't in full human likeness, there would be no need for reverence. But he had to take on full human likeness to show us true reverence that we could actually do ourselves. The other thing that it says is that he learned obedience through what he suffered. You know, you would think that if he's God in the flesh, he just automatically knows obedience, right? But he had to show us the way. &gt;&gt; Show us how to obey when we're suffering, which I'm sure we can all relate. when when when times are hard, when the trials come, it's not easy. You want to give up. Jesus can perfectly relate. &gt;&gt; And he was tempted in every way. But it says he did not sin. And it was through him obeying through suffering that he was perfected. And this is actually the I believe the meaning of picking up your cross daily. He this is what it looks like. the lifestyle, the daily decision as a Christian who follows Christ's. And you know, this passage I think could really do away with, I think, a major false doctrine in the world. You know, Christ didn't carry the cross so that you don't have to. &gt;&gt; Christ carried the cross so that you can do it as well. &gt;&gt; That's the point of this passage. And that, you're right, he suffered. He went through a lot. And he didn't just do it so you could just sit back on the couch couch, put a cross necklace on, put on some good sermons, you know, pray to Jesus every now and then, and that that makes you a Christian. No, &gt;&gt; he did all of that &gt;&gt; so that you could do it, too. &gt;&gt; He is the source of salvation. &gt;&gt; You know, there's something so amazing about about being a disciple and that something is carrying the cross. It is always carrying the cross. You know, Christians at this time, especially in Rome, at best were really being like pushed out and ostracized from society at best. And we already talked about it. At worst, they were being sewn into dead animal carcasses. Like that that was life. You know, you could come to church and you're living in Rome as a Christian and you could come to church and you're like, \"Oh, where's Bob? Where is Joe?\" You know, it's like, \"Oh, well, you know, one of them got fired. They're having a bad day. The other one was thrown into the pits.\" Oh, wow. And then you start worship service like that that could have been like every other Sunday. This was the call of a Christian. And you know, they wanted to find a way to love God at this time. They wanted to find a way to live righteously but not be persecuted. So they were drawing back in their convictions. But but Jesus didn't come to earth to prove himself, die, and to resurrect so that you could have the easy Christian life. &gt;&gt; That's not what he died for. &gt;&gt; And he didn't die on a cross so that you could never be persecuted. That's not what he died for. That he didn't just take on all the persecution himself. And that no one who follows him ever has to be persecuted. That that is a lie. That is not true. You know, he did not die on the cross and resurrect so that you can make your life's mission, your life's focus is to be rich, have a house on the mountain, and then look at God has exalted me to this position. I I just I but it's okay for me to have a little bit of greed because look at what he's given me. &gt;&gt; He did not die for that. &gt;&gt; You know, he didn't die so you could have the Instagram Christian aesthetic. &gt;&gt; He did not die for that. He did he did not die though I I myself like putting colors in my Bible. He did not die so that your entire walk with God can revolve around this. How many different highlighter colors you can put in your Bible? You know how many scriptures you can put on the back of your windshields? &gt;&gt; You know he didn't that's not Christian living. &gt;&gt; That's not what he died for. And the real the reality is I get it because you read passages like this and it's hard to relate because we're not being dragged off by wild bulls to our deaths. And so you look at this and you're like to to me suffering has different meaning. But I I think of the parable of the landowner and how he would hire servants early. Some faced the heat of the day and and you know the excruciating heat and worked way longer and way harder. Some came toward the last hour and that's us. That's really all of us. &gt;&gt; But we still get the same reward at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; But that that passage on one hand of course is focusing on the reward aspect that those who get persecuted to that degree and those of us whose suffering is looks very different that we all receive the same reward in heaven. But the other focus of that passage is that we all labor. &gt;&gt; That that there's no Christianity without carrying a cross. &gt;&gt; All of us labor. &gt;&gt; Even if we were hired at at at the last bit, even if we didn't face the the brunt of persecution, labor is labor. Every single one of us labors. &gt;&gt; And I think it's important not to try to make that cross too light. Don't try to make that cross too late because you might find yourself walking and you already dropped it some time ago because your goal was to make it weightless and then you realize you you you haven't had it for a while. &gt;&gt; Don't make that cross too late. And what is that cross? I believe it is right here in the scriptures. It says reverence and obedience. That's the cross. Do you fear God? And do you obey God? &gt;&gt; You know, Christ is the perfect example of reverence and obedience. And I I really And if you're struggling with that being your cross, I want you to see how far it could really take you. See what changes happen in your life when you decide to fear God the way Christ is trying to encourage you to. the way that you could obey God, the way that Christ made an example of. See how much it can lead you to a a freedom from your sin. I &gt;&gt; if you were just to revere God more, to obey him more. See uh about that peace, the peace that is the fruit of righteousness that comes from carrying your cross. See how much it could lead you to purity, to being blameless, to being holy in his sight. that these aren't just some ideals that that we say every now and then but we don't really believe in, but that Christ actually made it possible &gt;&gt; through reverence and obedience. You know, then you read scriptures like the tree planted by a stream. And it's no longer just a beautiful poem, a hopeful dream, an idea that you wish to have that you're half-hearted in belief about, but it's actually possible when you carry your cross with reverence and obedience. You know, I think it's simple. Bring attention to the reverence and obedience in your life. Make self assessments. Ask those around you, you know, see like, you know, is my reverence really as strong as it could be? Are the things keeping me from truly fearing God? Are there things that I fear more? Maybe it's people's opinions. Maybe it's, you know, maybe I think I'll look funny if I sing too loudly. May maybe I'm too concerned on how I share my faith, so I don't do it as much. Maybe I'm too concerned if I talk about the sin that I just saw my brother or sister do, and now it's on me to say it. But I'm I'm scared about what they think of me instead of being scared about the God that has authority over your soul. reverence and then obedience, right? Uh obedience is I I think it's obedience is powerful because we're always learning. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're always learning what it means to obey Christ every step of the way. I find obedience is is about being wholehearted in obeying him. &gt;&gt; What your walk is right now will be different than a year from now if you're seeking to obey him. And so when you look back a year and you're like, man, like I don't think I did as much, then that's okay. And that's the point that you're on that path &gt;&gt; and you're obeying him with all your heart in this moment. Let's keep reading in verse 11. It says, \"We have a great deal to say about this. Uh, and it is difficult to explain since you have become too lazy to understand. Although by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the basic principles of God's revelation. Again, you need milk, not solid food. Now, everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced with the message about righteousness because he is an infant, but solid food is for the mature. for those whose senses have been trained to distinguish between good and evil. Therefore, let us leave the elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, faith in God, teaching about ritual washings, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. And we will do this if God permits. You know, God now uh through the author, he made a little bit of a switch, right? So first the focus was looking at Christ's life, looking at his his earthly life and what it means for us. And then he talks about immaturity, not immaturity in the world of those who are lost in sin, but immaturity within the church, &gt;&gt; amongst disciples. And he says that it is difficult to explain because the disciples, the Christians have become too lazy to understand. And once again, the reason why their their desire right now, the point of the book of Hebrews is because these Christians who converted from Judaism mostly at of who this is directed to wanted to go back to their previous religion, want to go back to being Jewish, back to Judaism, right? And they because of this, they were misunderstanding the purpose of Jesus's earthly life. And that's why the author had to remind them. And even the literal translation of lazy to understand it says you're dull of hearing. Like almost like it's it's hitting your eardrum, but it's not getting to your brain. Like you're it just stops there. You're dull of hearing. And this was an issue. He's trying to teach them about the purpose of their Christian walk. That this is all this persecution. It's all understood by Jesus, but they weren't getting it. They weren't understanding us. And you could become a Christian and then slowly die. Because here we actually see how you know whenever you hear about in the Bible on scriptures that talk about you hear but you don't understand. You see but you don't perceive. How these people did understand did perceive and they became Christians. But who are the people that Jesus was relating those other passages to? But Pharisees. So they actually had the heart of a Christian. But over time when then when they wanted to go back to their previous walk with God, it wasn't just like I'm just going to go back. I know I'm falling away. But they didn't even understand. They started to have a pherocetical hearts. &gt;&gt; And that your heart could actually be and have different soils at different times in life. We know about the parable of the soils. &gt;&gt; We want to have the good soil. But you could actually not just be a bad soil and then be good. You can be a good soil and then be bad &gt;&gt; and then start to be hard of hearing. &gt;&gt; Start to have a hard heart even once you become a Christian, once you become a disciple, once you accept the word. And I I think what this talks about is think of it this way. You we we want to walk in step with Christ. We want to move as the spirit is moving. Amen. And you know, at least for me, it's easy to think as falling away as taking steps backwards. Like going back to a life of sin. I actually don't, if I were to make an analogy for this, I wouldn't say that this is referring to taking steps backwards. I would say it's just standing still. that Christ is moving forward with his cross up the hill and we have to be carrying one too, imitating him, &gt;&gt; but maybe we're not going backwards, but we just want to stand right here. &gt;&gt; You go on ahead, Lord. I I I I I don't want to go back to sin, but I definitely don't want to continue and be persecuted. That's one way to look at it. And I think we can relate to this passage in different ways. Lord, you can go on, but I don't want to forgive this brother. I don't want to go back to sin, but I don't want to forgive this brother. I don't want to forgive this sister. Lord, you know, I I could go forward, but just thinking about the things that were done to me make me so angry. &gt;&gt; I can't go on. I don't want to go back. I don't want to have a drinking problem again, Lord. But I'm not going forward. I'm staying right here. And you know, you can think that you're doing a good thing because you're thinking it's okay. It's a I'm not taking steps backwards. But you're standing still. You're not going where Christ is going. You have to walk with your cross. Standing still is not enough. And I find that carrying your cross is meant to have you be more like Jesus every step of the way. that that each step you take towards that hill, up that hill as Jesus carries his cross, that that same crucifixion is what brought him glory. &gt;&gt; That it was his obedience up until death proved to us that he is the perfect sacrifice &gt;&gt; and that's what we follow. &gt;&gt; That is who we follow. And the the point of this is really to grow that you can't be a disciple and not grow. You can't be, of course, you can't be a disciple and go backwards. &gt;&gt; You know, there's no such thing as a sinful disciple, &gt;&gt; but you also can't be a stagnant disciple. &gt;&gt; You have to be a disciple that moves with Christ, &gt;&gt; that moves forward. And and I find that when you do that and you die on the hill that he wants you to die on, that you actually will also end up being a source of salvation for those around you. that only through you obeying through suffering can you truly bring the gospel to other people &gt;&gt; and you're not just showing them, you know, as it says in uh Avengers Endgame, you know, I I lead them to a prize I cannot possess, &gt;&gt; but but you know where you're going and you know how to get there and you're showing others how to do that, too. &gt;&gt; Point number two is simply pick the right path. Pick the right path. It could be one of these three. You walk with Christ, you go backwards from Christ, or you stand still. And there's only one path you want to be on, and that's forward. And every disciple has to make a choice. Let's read verse four. It says in chapter six, for it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gifts, who shared in the Holy Spirit, who tasted God's good word and the powers of the coming age, and who have fallen away. This is because to their own harm they are recrucifying the son of God and holding him up to contempt. For the ground that drinks the rain that often falls on it and that produces vegetation useful to those that produce that for whom it was cultivated receives a blessing from God. But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and about to be cursed and at the end will be burnt. You know, you have to pick the right path. &gt;&gt; And for someone to continue on this path, you cannot willingly decide to be immature. What what is immaturity? Immaturity looks like this. It is personified in this passage by the example of rain, right? God sends rain on everybody. He wants the a good vegetation that the cultivates. But instead of good fruits, good vegetation cultivating on you, all it produces is thorns and thistles. And then if you go back a few verses, what is that really? It's your recrucifying God all over again. You're putting him back on the cross. And you know if we go backwards right the the passage says that it is difficult to explain this to you because you're lazy to understand and that really that means that you're dull of hearing. You know what the author is saying here was it's impossible to renew to repentance. He's not saying once you fall away you can't come back. That's not what he's saying. He's saying I've done all that I could. Only God can help you now. I've shown you what I can show you. You've already been enlightened by the word. I've made you into a disciple. You know what it means to follow Christ. I if if you're choosing to, you know, apostasize, leave the faith, that's completely between you and God. It's not because of ignorance. It's not because I didn't pour enough encouragement into you. It is literally just because you have decided to have a hard heart. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Luke chapter 18. Luke 18 in verse 24 it says seeing that he became sad. Jesus said how hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God. For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. Have you guys ever tried sewing before? But who here has tried sewing? I have. Whenever like a button will fall off, you know, I just don't want to pay for it. So, I'll try sewing it myself. And whenever you try sewing, you have to put the the thread through the eye of the needle. It takes me like a hundred tries and then you try like rolling it to get it like pointy. It's so impossible. But now Jesus is relating putting a camel through that same hole. &gt;&gt; And when you think that that is logistically impossible like like I can barely put what's meant to go through that hole in that hole. It's just not going. And they hear this and of course they think the same thing in verse 26. Those who heard this asked then who can be saved? He replied what is impossible with man is possible with God. You know, once again, it's not saying that if you fall away, you can't come back, but and that is it's impossible for you to get restored. It's just saying there's nothing a person on earth can help you with anymore. It's just you and God. Think of 1 Corinthians chapter 3. I planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow. you know, you do all the planting you can, all the watering you can, and now it's just up to God. Uh, in Romans, it says that it's not dependent on human effort or will, but on God who gives mercy. And so, you know, what happens is it reaches a critical point with everyone, even every one of us here, that following God is actually not dependent on what anyone could show us anymore. just literally up to us in God. Will we have a soft heart? &gt;&gt; Will we hear what he's trying to reveal to us? You know, I think sometimes even for me, it's like maybe if I could show you more truth, more benefits to peace, more about how living righteously is possible, you know, the ins and outs of doctrines. But that's not the case. It's just them and God. And I find, you know, as a Christian, it helps actually bring the load off of it's not dependent on us. It's dependent on God. &gt;&gt; And so when you feel like you've done everything you could do, that's actually true. Sometimes you've done all that you could do. It's just them and God. But I I think at the same time, we have to do all that we can do. We have to labor so that it truly is dependent on a person in God. Let's keep going. Uh when you go back to the passage, you know, at least for me, uh when I was reading Hebrews, I'm trying to reconcile the this the seemingly, you know, abrupt transition from Jesus's earthly life to you're immature to don't fall away. you know, at least for me, trying to understand that transition. And of course, the the Bible, especially especially each individual book is uh is a is is a a journey. You you're guided by each step of the way, right? And you know that this correlation when it goes from immaturity to Jesus's life, the falling away that is actually deeply correlated. And I think what is what I believe the passage is really trying to teach us is that you you cannot move forward if you're only living on milk. Let me give you some stat statistics of what happens when you only live off of milk. &gt;&gt; Specifically, when you're born and you take in milk, but you never go on to solid food. &gt;&gt; And I had to ask it twice because sometimes it's not very clear to me. So of course the first six months it's normal and healthy. Um and the next uh 6 to 12 months this is what many people would call the transitionary period. Um that's when iron and zinc uh zinc deficiency start to develop. Um you have now slower weight gain or growth delay might begin. So you got to start taking solid food. uh the baby might become more prone to infections um since iron levels um don't have enough immunity uh to fight off other things yet. I'm still trying to understand this. I'm no doctor. Um one one to two years, right? Um one to two years old, the a nutrition imbalance starts to grow and now the the milk the mother's milk no longer meets energy and nutrient needs. Uh signs may include anemia which is from low iron, delayed tooth eruption, um slow growth, height and weight are below average and delayed uh motor and speech developments. Two to five years is malnutrition and developmental delays become evidence. Uh there's lack of protein, vitamins, minerals from other foods that lead to weak bones. uh poor muscle tone, uh a weakened immune system, your your more frequent ill illnesses happen to you, uh cognitive delay, slower speech and and learning. And this is the part that's interesting is it says at 5 to 10 years that severe undernourishment and social impact happen, right? Says the the child may appear they appear like they look like it, but they're not. They appear much younger than their peers. Uh there's uh tooth and jaw underdevelopment because they've never chewed solid food. Uh there's chronic fatigue and weakened immune system. Uh psychological or behavioral dependence um on breastfeeding may form. But and then it goes on to adolescence and adulthood, right? And we can understand that organ damage, you know, the psychological dependence again, stunned height, weak bones, pretty much everything we read before. But it wasn't quite clear to me because it said um from 10 years onwards to adulthood. But I'm like, can a person really live that way? And so I I I had to ask another question. I was like, when does someone actually like die? When do they reach a point to where they're in a critical zone and they could die from only living off of milk? And it was kind of misleading because it gave me five to 10 years, but basically after five years, you're now in the red and you could die at any moments. So even though it explains, you know, 10 years past to adulthood that you actually have you could die a lot sooner around five years old or so. And so it it the passage is powerful when you go back to it. It's saying that you you go back to milk, but you cannot stay on milk. You have to go to solid food. And and I think that if we just look at the understanding, which I'm sure they had at the moment, is that if you stay on solid food, you will die. So there's the transition from if you don't understand your life in Christ and you stay on milk, then you will fall away. You will die. But what is solid food? I think that's the next question. What what is it mean to have solid food? &gt;&gt; Um well, solid food is not Bible knowledge. Solid food is not just I know more about the Bible than my peer so therefore I am mature that's not it's not solid food solid food is it says it's for the mature right so you it means you've already are able to distinguish good and evil that is when you could have solid food and my passage says that those whose senses have been trained senses it just means your organ for perception quite literally maturity is dependent on how you view the world around you that is maturity. That if your maturity is not evolving from that which you first become a Christian, if your view on the world is not evolving from that which you first become a Christian, you will fall away. &gt;&gt; That's the warning. And and the I think we're talking about growing, right? Doing more from Christ, evolving from when you first become a disciple. And sometimes when we hear the word more, we think I can't do anymore. But I'm actually not talking about doing more. I'm not talking about filling your schedule with more ministry. &gt;&gt; That's not the point of what I'm saying. I'm not saying maturity means you've everyone's in the full-time ministry now. You know, we're all supported by the contra of each other, which we also get from the contro of each other. Like, that's not what I'm talking about here. &gt;&gt; But but but more is not doing more, but being more. &gt;&gt; Being more like Christ. &gt;&gt; Being more indignant on your sin. &gt;&gt; And maybe you already have a great schedule, but you're not indignant enough. I'm talking about being more zealous in your worship. &gt;&gt; You know, you read the Bible. Do you still read the same things and now you're getting bored over the word of God. You're not growing in your interests. You're not growing in your fascination and your stagnance. &gt;&gt; Being more zealous when you sing to God. I think we we do songs leading up here. We have the five-part harmonies for a reason. It's so you can learn them because you you want to not just sing to God, but sing to God with with skill and passion, right? You can teach the word of God, but you don't just teach milk. You have to teach solid food. &gt;&gt; You have to grow from the current state in which you're at. &gt;&gt; You know, are are you growing in being more loving &gt;&gt; towards your brothers and sisters, right? Or or do you have the same level of love? I go to the meetings of the body. That's it. Or maybe that's even where you're struggling even just doing that. And I'm not even talking about seeing them more often. But when let's say you come to Sunday, is is there more intent in your fellowship? &gt;&gt; Is there more intent in your love? Intent in seeing what's happening in their life and how you can help, how you can encourage, tell them about your life and you be vulnerable. Is there more is there more love? I'm not saying do more acts of love, but just be more loving, &gt;&gt; being more gentle, being more God-fearing. You know, we have to be more Christlike with every breath we take, with every step that we take. Are you doing that? Are you being more Christlike? And once again, it's not about where you're currently at that you have to be perfect right now, but are you walking with Christ up that hill? You don't want to die where you're at. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you don't want to stand where you're at specifically. You want to die as you're walking with him. May maybe you you if you're dying on your way, but you're right you're standing right next to Jesus. That's where he wants you to be because you're doing the best you can right now. Let's keep reading. We'll end it off here &gt;&gt; in verse nine. It says, \"Even though we are speaking this way, do you love friends? In your case, we are confident of things that are better and pertain to salvation. For God is not unjust. He will not forget your work and the love you demonstrated for his name by serving the saints and by continuing to serve them.\" Now we desire each of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end, so that you won't become lazy, but you will be imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and perseverance. For when God made, excuse me, a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself, I will indeed bless you and will greatly multiply you. And so after waiting patiently, Abraham obtained the promise. For people swear by something greater than themselves and for a confirming oath ends every dispute because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise. He guaranteed it with an oath. So that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us. We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain. Jesus has entered there on our behalf as a forerunner because he has become a high priest forever according to the order of Mazdc. You know verse 10 it says God will not forget your work. He sees all you're doing and and maybe it's easy to be hard on oursel. Maybe I'm not doing enough. And and if you take what I'm saying as you're not doing enough, I I would urge you to maybe go back and maybe ask someone else. But it it's about doing the best you can right now. &gt;&gt; And if you're doing that, it says God sees your work. And then it continues on. It says he has made a covenant oath with us. That he has made a promise. A and what is this promise? Some view this promise as God never lets go. But it's not that God never lets go of you. That his promise is his arm will always be extended. His arm is always there for you to lay hold of. And of course, you know, the right arm of God is Jesus. And that that he is the extension, the opportunity, the chance to have forgiveness and freedom and hope in your life is just a seize away. You have to grasp it. Bless you. And it says in verse 18 that we have fled for re we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize that hope before us. So what does it take to take hold of his arm? What does it take to hold on until the very end? It takes strong encouragements. &gt;&gt; Not not just any encouragement which it clarifies. It says strong encouragements. And I think this is important. God knows what every human soul needs. &gt;&gt; God knows what we all need to make it to heaven. Sometimes we think we know what we need more than God says what we need. You're like, \"God, I think I need isolation. God, I think I need a break from you. God, I think that I need less encouragement. Actually, I think if disciples could encourage me less, that would get me to get to where you want me to be, God. What I need is more. I need service to be uh singing to be this way. I need to hear the songs that I want to hear, God. I need to, you know, what what would really help me have strong encouragement is every person I share my faith with, if they were always open, that would be strong encouragement. &gt;&gt; Maybe you could encourage me with that. That would help me be faithful, God. If every time I open my mouth, I never failed. That would be encouraging, God. I would love that. You know, it'd be encouraging God if I was never tempted. That would be encouraging. That's not what he's saying that you need. Encouragement means to call near to oneself. And then it makes sense when it goes a few passages above this. It says, \"Be imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and perseverance.\" Think about who are the best examples of faith and perseverance in your life. You know, I think Lisa came up here and shared a great communion, &gt;&gt; an incredible communion of being jobless, not to her own fault, to having her car totaled, not to her own fault, and having to work through all of this, you know, having a place to live, trying to be the best example she could be. And if you saw her on any of those Sundays, you would never guess that. &gt;&gt; An incredible example &gt;&gt; of faith and perseverance. You know, I think people have come up here for a communion before. We had Anthony and Liz come up here for a communion &gt;&gt; and all the all the losses they've they're also enduring things that they didn't choose to have like the a lawsuit for something that they literally weren't even present for and they're being sued for. They weren't even there and they have to pay for it. Imagine you're minding your own business and you get a mail saying you have to pay tens of thousands of dollars for something that you didn't even know happened until you read that letter. And yet still I want to share my faith because I have faith left to share. I I have examples of those who are guiding me through. You know, I believe the the point of this passage though is the strong encouragement is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Encourage means to call near. God came down from heaven to have the same weaknesses as us and then call us near to him. He wasn't just calling us near from a position where we couldn't relate, we couldn't understand. He made himself capable of empathizing with every weakness that we have. And he is our strong encouragement. He He calls us near. And that's who we all need. We need to focus on Jesus, &gt;&gt; to focus on Christ, to to actually seize the arm of God and have strong encouragements. And so, if I could encourage you with anything today, it is to seize like you've never seized before. cling to Christ like you've never clinged before. You know, you're doing more for God, but because you're being more for God, you're not thinking of, you know, just this or that, how to do more ministry. Is how can I be more Christlike, more zealous, more indignant, more loving, more gentle, more patient, more kind, all these different things. How how can I be more for Christ? How can I be more like Christ? Every day is a battle. I know, you know, we all know. But most importantly, Christ knows. &gt;&gt; He knows the battle. He knows the struggle. And he is our great strong encouragements. So, let's carry our cross daily and focus on Christ. To God be all the glory. [Music] [Laughter] [Music]",

    "transcript": "[Music] Uh, imagine yourself right now as a Christian in Rome during 65 AD. &gt;&gt; What a time to be alive. And you know, you've either became a Christian maybe even from one of the apostles &gt;&gt; or one of the students of the apostles and you've seen great miracles. The the the the lame are able to walk, the blind are able to see. You you see the sicknesses, tremendous sicknesses healed. And however at this time you are undergoing massive persecution. You know reasons why you would be persecuted at this time is because you know you don't conform to society. Rather even without saying a word your life is a criticism on pagan life. &gt;&gt; You know you refuse to worship other gods. You know, the state religion of this time is Greek mythology. And you find it hard to barely keep a job, you know, because of the common belief system. There's constant social pressure, daily social pressure on having you reject Christ, reject your Lord. And because of your closed meetings, your constant closed meetings, society and the government now is very wary of you. and they're concerned and suspicious of what's happening in your closed meetings. And so they they hear these words and they they use these different words to create just crazy rumors about you. &gt;&gt; One is, you know, actually the claim that you're an atheist because you have no statue of God to point to like everyone else does. Uh, one is this claim that, oh, wow, Christians are incestuous, meaning that they they say they marry their brother and sister in Christ. That's crazy. You know, they they they call you a cannibal &gt;&gt; because you're nourished and you live off of the body and blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And these rumors are going on about you. And whenever there's a natural disaster, they blame you because you didn't pray to Zeus or Poseidon. You know, because of your high ethical standards, you take a stance on societal issues. Things like the Gladiators Coliseum, considering it inhumane. And anyone who participates and likes to watch those things are also inhumane. And you take your stance. that even though you you love all, you are persecuted by all. Here in 65 AD specifically, your emperor at this time, the the ruler of your country is Nero. &gt;&gt; And Nero, if you could imagine a spoil, deranged, psychotic psychopath &gt;&gt; as your ruler. &gt;&gt; Here are some things that Nero did. In 59 AD, he had his mother killed. When his wife Sabina died, he had her embalmed, stuffed, and put at the entrance of a grand mazul mausoleum for everyone to see. And it gets a lot worse, but I'm going to end it at this. The worst one that I even don't even feel the most comfortable to say is that he castrated and publicly married a young boy &gt;&gt; in front of everybody. And so, and that is of the stuff that I feel slightly there. There's even worse things that this man has done that I find severely inappropriate to still say those things out loud. And this man is your emperor. &gt;&gt; He is your ruler. There was a six- day fire that happened around this time in 64-65 AD. And many people, some think that Nero blamed the Christians, some think that he didn't, many historians. However, around this time, he still was in charge of a grand persecution of Christians, burning them at the stake in his garden. And for anyone who dislikes Christians to come in and see this circus of his, he would take Christians and sew them inside of dead animal carcasses. and have wild dogs feed on these animals. He would uh tie them to wild bulls until they're dead. He would do these terribly graphic things for his own amusements. And it was against your people, maybe even against those in your house church, maybe even someone that disciples you and someone that helped baptize you. And you come to church the next day and they were falling victim to Nero. Imagine Christianity at this time. And even at this state in time, two titans in the faith, Peter and Paul the apostles, died specifically at the hand of Nero. And so now you're wondering, is it worth continuing? This is the context of the book of Hebrews. &gt;&gt; This is what's happening and why this letter is being written. You know that we we talked last time of this great persecution, this apostasy, meaning people leaving Christianity, going back to their old way of life, this is why that was life for them at this time. And you know, even though the trials that we face now are really incomparable to what they had to go through, &gt;&gt; I know that I don't just speak for myself when the thoughts come to my mind of maybe things would be different if I went back to my old lifestyle. May maybe there'd be some reward, some gain if m I could just go back to my old way of life. Well, if you're struggling with those thoughts, the book of Hebrews is for you. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 3. out. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 3 and verse one says, \"Therefore, holy brothers and sisters who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession. He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was in all God's household. For Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder has more honor than the house. Now, every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God. Moses was faithful as a servant in God's house, in all God's households, as a testimony to what would be said in the future. But Christ was faithful as a son over his household. And we are that household if we hold on to our confidence and the hope in which we boast. You know, if you share in heaven's call, just take a moment right now and consider Jesus. Think about what he had to go through. You know, it says that he is the apostle and high priest, meaning he is the messenger and atoner of our confession. But what is a confession? What does that word even mean? A confession literally means what you claim to be yours. What you believe is your possession. You know our title for us today is simply today what is your confession today? What do you claim to be yours? What do you claim when the day comes you want to boast in? You're glad to have glad to be doing. What is your confession today? And under all of this persecution, what their hope was was that maybe if they reverted back to Judaism, there wouldn't be that much of a difference in following God a different way. That was what they were putting their hope in. And the author had to remind them, hey, no, you know, you are going backwards. That you are serving the servant of a household while Jesus is the son. He is the heir. He owns the house. Don't go backwards. And I hope by the end of this lesson and prayerfully every lesson, every d time, every Bible talk, every midweek, every debo, every time you hear the word of God preached, it could only push you along further to extend your Christianity, &gt;&gt; to extend your disciplehip. You know, maybe this lesson is another month. Maybe you have a great D time that adds another year like that. You just hear the word of God and it keeps you pushing. And our first and only point today is there is a promise up ahead. There is a promise up ahead. Let's keep reading in verse 7. It says, \"Therefore, as the holy script spirit says, today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion on the day of testing in the wilderness where your ancestors tested me, tried me, and saw my works for 40 years. Therefore, I was provoked to anger with that generation and said, \"They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways. So I swore in my anger, they will not enter my rest.\" Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won't be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage each other daily while it is still called today, so that none of you is hardened by sin deception. For we have become participants in Christ if we hold firmly until the end. the reality that we had at the start as it said uh today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion for who heard and rebelled wasn't it all who came out of Egypt under Moses with whom was God angry for 40 years wasn't it with those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness and to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest if not those who disobeyed see we so we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief You know, this passage is directly referencing the Exodus in where they go to the promised land, but for 40 years, those who sinned and rebelled against God, God let die off until they actually entered the promised lands. And we know that if you read Exodus, there's many times that they rebelled. There are many times that they opposed God, many times when they were complaining, all these different things. But it's referring to one specific time when God said, \"I I had the final straw.\" Well, we c I cannot allow this wicked generation to enter this promise. Let's go see it in Numbers 13. &gt;&gt; Let's get a little context. &gt;&gt; So, in Numbers 13, they they travel out of Egypt and they come to the promised land, the land of Canaan. And Moses has 12 men, one from each tribe, go and scout the lands. And let's see what the report was when they came back. It says in verse 26 of chapter 13 of Numbers, the men went back to Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community in the wilderness of Piranakadesh. They brought back a report for them and the whole community, and they showed them the fruit of the land. They reported to Moses, \"We went into the land where you sent us. Indeed, it is flowing with milk and honey, and here is some of its fruit. However, the people living in the land are strong, and the cities are large and fortified. We also saw descendants of Anac there. The Amalachites are living in the land of the Negev, and the Hethites, Jebusites, and the Amorites live in the hill country, and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan. Then Caleb quieted the people in the presence of Moses and said, \"Let's go up now and take possession of the land because we can certainly conquer it.\" But the men who had gone up with him responded, \"We can't attack the people because they are stronger than we are.\" So they gave a negative report to the Israelites about the land they had scouted. The land we passed through to explore is one that devours its inhabitants. And all the people we saw in it are men of great size. We even saw the Nephilim there. The descendants of Anac come from the Nephilim. To ourselves, we seem like grasshoppers. And we must have seemed the same to them. You know, they left Egypt. Why? Because they were enslaved for 400 years. And the distance between Egypt to Canaan is about 11day journey. So it actually only took them a week and a half to get to the promised land. &gt;&gt; And they scout the lands and they get this report and this false report is spread and literally the what many commentators say is that there are around 2 million people of the Jewish nation at this time. That's including men, women, and children. And of those who didn't believe the negative report was three men. It was well four. It was Aaron, Moses, Caleb, and Joshua. &gt;&gt; But Moses and Aaron weren't able to enter. So out of all two million people, only two men actually had a good report and were allowed to enter. Out of two million, that's a one in a million chance. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And let's see in verse one of chapter 14, the very next verse, it says, \"Then the whole community broke into loud cries, and the people wept that night, all the Israelites complained about Moses and Aaron. And the whole community told them, \"If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness. Why is the Lord bringing us into this land to die by the sword? our wives and children will become plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt? So they said to one another, \"Let's appoint a leader and go back to Egypt.\" Then Moses and Aaron fell face down in front of the whole assembly of the Israelite community. Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jeffa, who were among those who scouted out the land, tore their clothes and said to the entire Israelite community, \"The land we passed through and explored is an extremely good land. If the Lord is pleased with us, he will bring us into this land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and give it to us. Only don't rebel against the Lord. And don't be afraid of the people of the land, for we will devour them. Their protection has been removed from them, and the Lord is with us. Don't be afraid of them. While the whole community threatened to stone them, the glory of the Lord appeared to all the Israelites at the tent of meeting. An insane story. and how they got there likely within 11 days. And it was because of this specific instance that God says even in verse 11 that the people despise him and that they do not trust God despite the miracles that he has shown them. And so they went to the border and God said, \"You know what? You're not worth entering.\" And they're routed for 40 years until all of the unbelieving nation dies off. &gt;&gt; And then once they're all dead, then they enter. When they were literally right there, just about to enter. And you know, I I think it's a powerful analogy for us because when you go back to Hebrews, let's turn though really briefly and tie these two together because the Bible doesn't put things together without reason. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you have here in Hebrews, we just talked about this massive persecution. And what were they facing but torture and death. And when the Israelites, you know, thousand a few thou thousand years a thousand years prior are about to enter the promised land, what do they see? They see the the Anakim. And likely they were giants. It said they felt like grasshoppers to them. is that if we enter that land, surely we would die. Why shouldn't we just stay here and die? God, why did you kill us in the wilderness? Why didn't you kill us in Egypt? Let us go back. It's the same exact scenario. Th this fear of death allowing them to make excuses believing maybe it's better that we never made it here in the first place. Maybe we shouldn't have made it this far. God, why would I be a Christian if all it means is torture and death? God, why would you want us to enter the promised land? They're clearly giants. They're clearly bigger than us and stronger than us. God, you only want us to die. You know, and it ties these different concepts with unbelief. It says that it was their unbelief in verse 19 that didn't allow them to enter. I believe that looking at these passages, there are three signs, if not three phases of unbelief. One is as you see is believing or spreading a false a negative reports &gt;&gt; and simply put is there something else triumphing over your faith to conquer the lands. &gt;&gt; You know what happens is God puts out this great plan in front of you and the reality is you cannot do it on your own strength. &gt;&gt; You cannot evangelize Tampa on your own strength. &gt;&gt; We cannot save a person on our own strength. It requires God &gt;&gt; and his word. And then you see someone going through immense addiction, immense struggles, and all the people that God is calling you to help save. You say, \"Maybe I'm not the person for the job.\" And you're overcome with fear, overcome with doubts, overcome with hopelessness, timidity, maybe even self-reliance, thinking that you can do it but without God, which we even see them do later because God says, \"Don't go.\" Oh, but they tried it anyways. &gt;&gt; And you know the the answer to these things is in verse 13 of Hebrews. It says, \"Encourage one another daily.\" &gt;&gt; You know, we did a whole lesson on encouragement a few months back and how necessary it is to continue your disciplehip to the point of dying faithful. &gt;&gt; We need encouragements. &gt;&gt; And it's even amplified here. And uh the second thing I believe uh the the second sign of unbelief is as you saw what they did was complaining. You know complaining simply is expressing dissatisfaction or annoyance. And it's a sign of unbelief. But why is it a sign of unbelief? because rather than moving forward, you get fixed on issues that aren't in God's sight and you you've halted yourself. Um, and instead you should be focusing on what God finds important. You have now decided to make important an issue that God doesn't want you to focus on. The word complain in the Hebrew in the chapter that we just read, it literally means to lodge, to to camp, the to to set up your tent, &gt;&gt; that that you've decided this is where I'm going to stay. &gt;&gt; This is where I'm I'm not moving forward, God. That's that's what the word complain literally means. And so complaining is standing your ground when God wants you to keep moving forward. That is complaining. And it what it is is you turn a pebble in your path into a boulder. &gt;&gt; Oh man. &gt;&gt; You to you know those hurdles that those track stars do? I can I can never do the footwork. My front foot always hits the hurdle. You know it's turning a hurdle into a brick wall. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; There's nothing you can do. And you're like I'm just going to try to jump through it. Oh I guess I can't. There's a wall right there. I can't I can't move forward, God. And it's important to know because we do that actually because we want to stay there. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It is not complaining is not an involuntary decision. We complain. We lodge. We set up our tent in a spot where God says no. Keep moving forward because we would rather stay or maybe even go back. But what we don't want to do is go forward. &gt;&gt; That is complaining. And I find that maybe because of believing a false report, you think that's where you're supposed to be. That's why I think they're kind of like phases is because you believe in this negative report so much so that you think what is best for your safety, best for your security, even best for your walk with God is to stay put and not move forward. You know, lastly, I think the the third sign of unbelief that we see in both examples is finding people and a leader that accepts your complaints. &gt;&gt; What did it say that they do? It said that they complained to Moses and Aaron as if Moses and Aaron gave them the plan. &gt;&gt; It was God's plan. It was God's promise. God just happened to pick Moses and Aaron. But it was God's intention to go into the promised land. But what they said was, \"We want new leaders, someone who will take us back into Egypt, back into slavery.\" And it's quite powerful because it means that where you're lodged, that is where you draw the line. So what you do is you find friends, you find a church, you find a pastor, you find a mentor that instead of them calling you to move forward, they come to you and meet you where you're at. They accept your complaints. &gt;&gt; They they they they attend to your sinful nature rather than calling you out of your lodging, &gt;&gt; calling you out of your complaints. And it says, \"Those who do these things, those who disbelieve will not enter God's rests.\" you know, &gt;&gt; when uh you know, you're a kid and maybe your parents are thinking about taking you to Six Flags or Disneyland or wherever it is, you you might think that well, especially when you get older, you know, they've invested money into this. They've invested time into this. And maybe it's the psychology of kids that they start to act up on their way to somewhere special. They they start to at least for me, you know, I had siblings. We maybe we're we're in each other's faces cuz we're so amped up, so riled up. We're in the back of the car and just like pushing each other and nagging each other, you know, whatever it is. And but part of it is because it's it's going to be the best day ever that somehow we think that there's nothing that we could do that can make our mom turn the car around. &gt;&gt; And then and then you hear your mom or dad say, \"So help me.\" If you don't pack up your attitude, &gt;&gt; if you don't tone it down back there, I will turn the car around. &gt;&gt; And I I think you know we we as they did in the wilderness, they tested God. &gt;&gt; And we can do that, too. &gt;&gt; We God, you won't really take my salvation from me, will you? God, you you you won't really prevent me from entering the promised land if I rebel against you, &gt;&gt; if I sin against you, if I treat my brother this way, my sister this way, if I live in habitual sin this way. You won't really prevent me. God, look at what I've done. I I've I crossed the Jordan. We were in the wilderness. We saw Pharaoh and his army get slaughtered, drowning in the ocean. You were right there, God. you won't really prevent me from entering. It's just two steps away. Well, God, as our parents do, turned the car ride around &gt;&gt; for 40 years &gt;&gt; until until there was no Disneyland for them, &gt;&gt; until it was gone, until it was out of business. &gt;&gt; You know, I think it's time for us to get our act together &gt;&gt; so that as many of us as possible enter God's rest. Let's keep reading in chapter 4. &gt;&gt; It says in verse one, \"Therefore, since the promise to enter his rest remains, let us beware that none of you be found to have fallen short. For we also have received the good news just as they did. But the message they heard did not benefit them, since they were not unified with those who heard it in faith. For we who have believed enter the rest in keeping with what he said.\" So I swore my anger, they will not enter my rest, even though his works have been finished since the foundation of the world. For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in this way. And on the seventh day, God rested from all his works. Again, in that passage, he says, \"They will never enter my rest.\" Therefore, since it remains for someone for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news did not enter because of disobedience, he again specifies a certain day today. He specified this speaking through David after such a long time. Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts. For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. Therefore, a Sabbath rest remains for God's people. For the person who has entered his rest has rested from his own works, just as God did from his. Let us then make every effort to enter that rest so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience. You know this passage is really powerful and and you know when people read this passage that we just read there are actually two different forms of thoughts. One is the rest is in Christ and that the rest is symbolic of peace. And of course the the fruit of righteousness is peace and uh belief is that well this rest is peace. So once you are in Christ there's nothing more you can do right the the work is finished. Christ finished it all. So once you're a Christian that's it. You've rested from your works. The other major belief is that the rest following from uh which I believe the passage right before in chapter 3 is referring to the promised lands and the rest is referring to heaven's call in the beginning of chapter 3 and that is referring to heaven. It's referring to uh entering heaven when you die. And so we're going to talk about this and I've never done this before. And so I've shown pictures but not pictures like this. Uh, Nebby, let me tell you which one to show. Show the one. &gt;&gt; Show the first one I sent you. &gt;&gt; I said we actually have a video that I'll show later today too, which I've also never done. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. So &gt;&gt; yes sir. &gt;&gt; So let me &gt;&gt; Okay. So uh we're talking about interpreting the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh specifically Greek, right? Okay. So one of the biggest uh words that changes your interpretation of it is what does it mean by enter? What does the word enter mean? Right? Okay. So this is the Greek word for enter. Um and you right here. It's G1525, right? And the word is &gt;&gt; isoma. &gt;&gt; And so if you see &gt;&gt; this is the word is means enter. &gt;&gt; This is how it's used. But if you see there's two different words here. So this &gt;&gt; does and so so this is how it's used. But that's the actual word answer. The reason why the uh suffix is different is because of the way it's used. Think of any word like to walk, right? There's walking, there's walks, there's walk, there's I walk, I will walk, I have walked, I will be walking. And there's basically 12 to 16 tenses in the English uh language. And this is no different. It's the exact same thing, right? You have enter, but then you have how the word enter is used. Okay? So when you move over This is the second one. The first one &gt;&gt; time. &gt;&gt; Okay, there we go. &gt;&gt; So the reason why was the that one was verse 11. This is verse three. Um, okay. And so here, same thing. Enter, right? Is 1525, right? But once again, you can even to the different is a different way the word enter is used. And so enter is a verb and you have this PMI right here which stands for &gt;&gt; oh which stands for present middle indicative. So I'm telling you this because I actually oh I feel like a lot of my knowledge only comes from reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; If you asked me a month ago what present middle indicative means I would say you have two heads. &gt;&gt; I have no idea what that means. I barely remember English in high school. &gt;&gt; But you know the Bible says that Christians we can be unschooled ordinary men. Right? &gt;&gt; The Bible gets okay. &gt;&gt; So present this is important right? So if you look up what does present middle indicative mean? Uh it it literally means it describes an action happening in the present by the subject for their own benefit is currently being performed by the subject or is an action that the subject is involved in. &gt;&gt; So meaning that this enter doesn't mean that they have entered. It means they're they are currently entering right now as we speak. &gt;&gt; That if you are a Christian, you enter that rest. meaning it's like you're walking through a door, but you're not through the door yet. &gt;&gt; But it's kind of cool because the present means happening now. The the middle means that it's for your own benefit. And the indicative says it right here. It's a simple statement of facts. So when it means you're when it says you enter the rest, it means you are currently entering the rest for your benefit. And that's a fact. That's literally what it means. Um, which is really cool. And like I said, I would have never known that if you asked me a month ago. Um, but if you go to verse 11, right, it the another way that it's used, it says, \"Let us make every effort to enter that rest so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience.\" Okay, so now go to the second one, Nebby. &gt;&gt; Okay. So see how it's entered but different uh suffix and different way it's used. It says aoris active. So once again I have no I had no idea what this meant before I started this but the aoris active means it's complete without the ongoing action of the presence. So there's one sense where it says if you um if you believe you are in the process of the of entering you have you are entering but you haven't made it out yet. But then at the very end it says let us make every effort to enter meaning let us make every effort to finish our entering &gt;&gt; to actually make it until the end. So a Christian hasn't entered yet. We are still entering. &gt;&gt; A a disciple hasn't made it yet. &gt;&gt; You are still pushing through. And if you would believe me that depending on your trans like literally it's a single passage in the Bible that depending on your interpretation of it, you can make the excuse in a book that is literally saying do not fall back. Keep pressing forward. Yes, they're trying to kill you. Yes, they're trying to torture you, but keep going forward. that they somehow take an interpretation saying there's nothing you can do. It doesn't make sense in the context of the book of Hebrews. &gt;&gt; You know, it says in verse 10 that there is uh sorry, in verse 9 that there is a Sabbath rest and that it remains. You know, the word remains is said three different times in this part that it is yet to come. A Sabbath rest remains. What does that mean? It means the job's not finished. &gt;&gt; The job's not finished. Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; Nebby, please show that clip now. &gt;&gt; The job's not finished. Job's not done. &gt;&gt; We're entering the clip. [Music] Are you not happy? I don't think so. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He This is Kobe Bryant, right? And he's up 200 in the the finals, right? And &gt;&gt; he should be happy, but from what kind of sense? The Kobe's like, \"Why would I be happy? I we haven't won. &gt;&gt; We we we won a few battles, but the war is not done.\" You know, the the whole point of this passage is that you can't make it so far and then give up. &gt;&gt; You've only arrived once you're there. &gt;&gt; That you you know you've secured your position in heaven once you've made it until the end. &gt;&gt; The job's not done. &gt;&gt; If you're a disciple right now and you're still here in this room, which is all of us, the job's not done. &gt;&gt; We have to keep pushing. You know, it applied to those who were right there at the promised land. They made these excuses, their complaints, and they wanted a new leader. They wanted to go back and they died when they were inches away from entering the Canaan lands. &gt;&gt; You know, it happens for them. You know, they're struggling. Maybe we go back to Judaism. You know, persecution is too hard. But in reality, if they died, they would have made it. The job's not done. It applies to us today. The job's not done. A Sabbath day rest remains. The promised land is still up ahead. The promised land is still up ahead. And one day you will rest from your works, but that day is not today. &gt;&gt; That day is not today. You know, if Christ came back right now, could you tell him to his face that you're making every efforts? Could you say, \"Jesus, my Lord, I'm doing my best.\" And we have to be careful not to compare our best to other people. &gt;&gt; We're looking as it says in the beginning, consider Christ's. &gt;&gt; We're only looking at him. Jesus, I I've seen what you've done. I've seen how you lived. I'm doing my best for you. &gt;&gt; That is why I'm trying to enter. You know, if you're hearing this right now, it means you still have time. &gt;&gt; It means you still have time. That if you're thinking about drawing back, you have time to repent. that that that if you're trying to give your best, you still have time. God is not done with you right now. That the job is not done. There are still more souls to save. Let us make the decision not to get caught not working. &gt;&gt; Let us not be caught not working. &gt;&gt; You know, in verse 12, it says, \"For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating as far as the separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. No creature is hidden from him, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an account. Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way as we are, yet without sin. Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace with boldness so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need. &gt;&gt; You can choose right now. &gt;&gt; You can choose to give into unbelief, stopping your disciplehip shorts. And who knows when that day comes. &gt;&gt; Who knows when Jesus would have come? Who knows when a car crash might have happened? Who knows when a a war happens and then you bombs are sent to Tampa. Who knows? &gt;&gt; But if you give into unbelief when it's too soon, you won't make it into his rests. &gt;&gt; Or as the passage says, you can choose to be cut by God's word. &gt;&gt; You can choose, you know what, God, refine me. I want to make it. I want to be there. I I want to be with you in glory. And you know it talks about Jesus being our high priest once again our our messenger our atoner and it says let us hold fast to our confession. What is that confession from the beginning that Jesus is Lords &gt;&gt; we have to hold fast until the very end. &gt;&gt; Today is not enough tomorrow is enough. It is when we die that is when it'll be enough. &gt;&gt; That is when our works &gt;&gt; will be finished. It says that Jesus sympathizes with our weaknesses, though he never sins. A and think of who this is meant to be written to. Those who are struggling with, \"Well, if I'm a Christian, I'm going to be tortured. If I'm a Christian, they're going to kill me.\" Well, they're saying, \"Yeah, consider Jesus.\" &gt;&gt; Who who knew it was going to happen but still did it. &gt;&gt; Never since. never rebelled, always trusted in God, never never thought that God didn't love him, but he kept pushing forwards. And we have to consider Jesus now, we have to consider him now if we're going to keep going. You know, we do it because as we draw strength from him, as we enter his rest, as we save souls, as we unite families, you know, I have seen brothers and sisters in Christ in our churches across across the oceans in India, in Nepal, all around the world where literally they say that they were saved from an abusive household and that the husband used to beat their wife And now they're both disciples. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And there is no more physical abuse in their family. &gt;&gt; And now they have kids who are on their way to also becoming disciples. Like literally families are united. We have to keep going. &gt;&gt; You know, bringing love into people's lives. &gt;&gt; Friendships that they've never had before. Giving people hope. Ending this enslavement that they have to sin by preaching the gospel to them. you know because we do this not in comparison to anyone else that we can approach the throne with boldness. You're like God you know what I am confident not because of my own self-righteousness but because of what you have allowed me to do. I love you so much that I obey you I can strut towards your heavens not with my own self-righteousness but the one that you've given me. &gt;&gt; That is why we walk with boldness. And God says he gives us mercy and grace that &gt;&gt; Amen. He can sympathize with our weaknesses. He had no sin. But if we fall short, we can still get up. That there is still time to make it into the promised lands. You know, I want you guys to think about today. What is your confession? What will you proclaim to be yours the day you see Jesus? And to God be all the Lord. [Music] [Laughter] [Music]",

    "transcript": "[Music] Uh today we will look at of course as Liz was saying the book of Hebrews. &gt;&gt; Uh this is a shorter book. So the non the nonPaulian epistles uh only take up about 10% of the New Testament. Um so it's a very small amount. So, in comparison to the entire book of Ezekiel, my thought was that when we do this series, we'll actually look at it verse by verse. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Uh, the entire book. Um, and just kind of we can literally cover all of Hebrews in the same time, if not less than Ezekiel looking at every single verse. Um, because of how short it is. And so, I think it'll be awesome. We'll have a great time. Uh the title for today's lesson is Jesus is unashamed of you. &gt;&gt; Jesus is unashamed of you. And we'll tie it all together. Uh before looking at uh chapter 1 verse one, I want to give a brief intro into uh uh some details about Hebrews. So first it was written between 64 to 68 AD uh in the lifetime of some of the apostles. And uh one key thing that's super important about Hebrews is that no one knows for sure who wrote it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um there there's no intro where you know someone says their name like Paul or Peter or John or somebody. No, there's no intro like that. Um and I remember when I first learned this I'm like okay well if no one knows who wrote it, why is it in the Bible? Is it I think it's an interesting question to ask. Um, but basically though no one knows who wrote it, it is a confirmed fact that it was a letter that was commonly passed around during the time of the first century church. &gt;&gt; Um, even though there's no direct authorship. Um, and there's a few things that are also important that people in the church knew who wrote the book because there's different parts um in the book that kind of denote that like in chapter 13, 18, and 19. We're not going to turn there, but it it shows that the audience knows who the uh author of the book is, but we don't. But of course, God does, though. &gt;&gt; Uh the original name of the book is ProAbraas, which just means for Hebrews, and that's super important because, you know, the book is obviously to Christians. So, why is the title basically for Jews? Well, what was happening was there was this massive persecution of Christians at this time and specifically you had Jewish converts into Christianity telling themselves and kind of going back to Judaism because they were so scared and they were running from persecution where they're trying to be they were being killed. Say, you know what? if we go back to our old way of life, it's it has some similarities, but maybe if we don't call ourselves Christians, we don't live like them. We won't be persecuted. &gt;&gt; So, this actually is specifically addressed to Jewish converts into Christianity going back to Judaism and not persevering under trial. Um, and it kind of shows this in verse one. It says, \"Long ago, God spoke to our ancestors by the prophets at different times and in different ways. In these last days, he has spoken to us by his son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him. The son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact expression of his nature, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high. So he became superior to the angels just as the name he inherited is more excellent than theirs. And there's different themes in the book of Hebrews and words that are consistently repeated. One of them is this word superior or some translations say better, right? Um and some uh other words you you'll see the word perfect said a lot in the book of Hebrews. The word heavenly said a lot. All these words, better, superior, perfect, heavenly, is meant to describe Jesus's nature and who he is compared to the old way of living for God, Judaism. Why? Because once again, they want to turn back. It's like, why would you turn back to an old covenant? Jesus is the superior covenants. Why would you turn back to an old, you know, inferior uh relationship with God? Jesus is the superior and better relationship with God. And you see kind of this dynamic going back and forth. And um uh one thing that's really amazing about it is that this this comparison is is specifically done and I love about it because it's addressing those going through suffering. And you'll see in the first two books and how, you know, because of this great persecution, you know, you might think it's easier to back out of it, maybe take the easy route. If if I'm not persecuted, maybe my life will be okay. But the author is saying, \"But if you do that, you will give into an inferior way of life.\" Um, and that's why you see this exhortation towards pressing on to maturity, this call to putting away spiritual dullness and degeneracy and a focus on doctrine, the natur the nature of Christ and salvation. Um, but let's pick it up in verse 5. And point number one is simply Christ superior to the angels. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; superior to the angels. In verse 5, it says in Hebrews chapter 1, for to which of the angels did he ever say, you are my son. Today I have become your father or again I will be his father and he will be my son. Again he brings his firstborn into the world. He says and let all God's angels worship him. And about the angels he says he makes his angels winds and his servants a fiery flame. But to the Son, your throne, God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice. You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. This is why God your God has anointed you with the oil of joy beyond your companions. And in the beginning, Lord, you established the earth and the heavens are are the works of your hands. They will perish, but you will remain. They will all wear out like clothing. You will roll them up like a cloak and they will be changed like clothing. But you are the same and your years will never end. Now to which of the angels has he ever said, \"Sit at my right hand until I make you an enemy make your enemies your foottool? Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve those who are going to inherit salvation?\" Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, it's it's amazing the this letter to these Christians, these disciples going back to their old way of life that was opposite of living for Christ. The first thing that the author wants to talk about is the deity of Jesus. It is a first thing message. You would think, you know, he would say don't give up, you know, just believe in yourself. But the first thing he wants to talk about is how powerful Jesus is. that he is not just some messenger. &gt;&gt; You know many other you know doctrines, religions even in Hinduism, Buddhism and obviously Islam they believe that Jesus is just some powerful messenger. But the Bible says no no no he he is not just some messenger some angel some some messenger from heaven. He is the only one God has ever said to other angels to worship him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He he is the only one that he has called to say come sit at my right hand. And you get this idea that Jesus is obviously superior than any other messenger that that there has ever been. &gt;&gt; And I think this is important because the the deity of Jesus is not just important for starting your faith, but for keeping it. &gt;&gt; And that when you're going through trials, you know, it's actually important to kind of go back to why you first became a Christian in the first place, which is a focus on the deity of Jesus. Go to Luke chapter 20. All right. &gt;&gt; Because it says in verse 13, \"Sit at my right hand.\" You know, that comes from a psalm. But Jesus himself actually quotes this psalm. And let's see what he says in Luke 20. And here he's talking to the Pharisees in verse 41 of Luke 20. It says, \"Then he said to them, how can they say that the Messiah is the son of David? For David himself says in the book of Psalms, \"The Lord declared to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your foottool.\" David calls him Lord. How then can he be his son? So, remember how we looked at Ezekiel and I was saying how some people look at this Davidic figure as someone that's not a messianic or a being that is above man. and they just look at it as some um earthly ruler who would rule over some army, right? So, this is actually a belief that Jews then have and Jews even today have. And Jesus actually goes back to this passage that they would use to talk about, you know, David is some army ruler that's going to come back and say, \"No, no, that's not talking about David. It's talking about me.\" &gt;&gt; Why? Because it says, \"The Lord declared to my Lord.\" So, he's like, \"Guess what? There's actually two Lords here.\" If we know that we you know in um in Jewish culture you you know give uh reverence towards your ancestors to a degree. So why would David who is um in the ancestry line give reverence to someone that comes later than him unless he is Lord above him? &gt;&gt; And so what Jesus does as he always does is he kind of attacks people's beliefs with questions which I I think is a great way to do it. Amen. But but here's what it is. Is that this Messiah that's going to come, is he going to be just man in every single way, just like how they are, or will he be even higher than the angels? And this is necessary when it comes to endurance, &gt;&gt; realizing the power of Jesus. You know, how often do you think about the power that Christ has? Come on. &gt;&gt; How often do you think that, you know, we talk about how he he died on the cross? He he bled and he was naked and he and someone else had had to carry up that cross for him because of how much he was tortured. But at the same time, we can't just picture him dying on the cross. We have to picture him on the throne in heaven. &gt;&gt; That that Christ has power &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; above anyone else. And uh you know I I think um you know it's it's so important as someone that has fallen away myself before &gt;&gt; what happens when you forget that Christ has power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know and I know even for me is well when the the time comes and you're even thinking to yourself like wow like do I want to throw in the towel right now? &gt;&gt; Do I want to start the drawback? Do I wanna, you know, start start going back in what I believe? What it really comes down to, I believe, is a lack of focus on who Christ really is in my life. &gt;&gt; And um, you know, I think maybe some of us have had moments like that. Maybe even right now, we're starting to consider it. Maybe some of us here of, you know, what what'll happen if I start to draw back on things that I knew were true? What'll happen if I start to stop doing or stop believing things that I know will get me closer to Christ? But as you get closer to Christ, what that really means is you're becoming more like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what it means to be closer to Christ. And if you're becoming more like him, I promise you, you will have more of these moments. &gt;&gt; You will have more moments where you're asking yourself, is it worth really pushing through? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is it really worth continue to go on through suffering, through these trials, and you will always come to a decision, and maybe you've come to it many times before, maybe you're at it for the first time right now, is I could give up my life and I could choose to live in in an inferior way of living. And of course, that inferior way is my way. or I can give into what God is calling me to do and I can choose to live according to God's power the superior way and you will hit that crossroads and you have to come to a decision and you know I I I love it because if you choose the path of power then you are choosing Christ if you choose the path of endurance you are choosing Christ if you choose to live in a way that you know like you I I could draw back in coming to church, I can draw back and have my quiet times and praying and meeting with my brothers and sisters and sharing my faith. But when you choose to live by his power, you are choosing Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's what's so powerful about this. Let's keep reading in chapter 2 &gt;&gt; in Hebrews chapter 2. It says in verse one, \"For this reason we must pay attention all the more to what we have heard so that we will not drift away. For if the message spoken through the angels was legally binding, and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment, how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?\" This salvation had its beginning when it was spoken of by the Lord and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him. At the same time, God also testified by signs and wonders, various miracles and distributions of gifts from the Holy Spirit according to his will. Point number two is Christ is fully human for our freedom. &gt;&gt; Christ is fully human for our freedom. And it takes a kind of a dramatic shift. It goes from he has all the deity. He is above any other messenger. he is from heaven, that he is the exact representation of God's nature. Two, he's also human. And we're going to see that further on in this chapter. And but let's go back to this these few verses here. It says that we must pay close attention that we do not drift away. And what is that message? It is simply that Jesus is Lord. You must pay careful attention to that. And the opposite in verse three, it says that um that we could try to avoid it if we neglect it. That it says that how will we escape if we neglect this message? You know, this word neglect in Greek, it literally means to be careless and to make light of. Oh, &gt;&gt; and you kind of see this this comparison happening is that you could either pay careful attention and you know looking at every detail like you know what I want to take my walk with God seriously or you can start to take things lightly. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Not take them as seriously. not put as much uh care and attention toward. You know, I used to think that falling away, ever seen those movies where, you know, friends, they take uh maybe a friend of theirs that's sleeping at at night and they take their whole bed and put it in like the middle of a lake and like they wake up like, \"Oh, how'd I get here?\" You know, and then they see their friend, you put me here, you know? I used to think that falling away was like that, you know, that you wake up one day, you're like, \"How'd I get Satan?\" You know, why'd you put me in this position? you know, and that it's like all of a sudden it's like out of the blue. But I I find that what falling away really is is like a a hurricane coming in and you have people warning you, you have to leave. You're in an evacuation center. You have to you're where your zone, you're in the red zone, and you're like, \"Nah, I don't think that's going to happen. I don't I don't believe in hurricanes.\" You know, I've I've I've gone through them before. if they've never been a big deal. I've always toughed it out. And then what happens is the water starts coming to your ankles and you're like, nah, it's going to stop right there. It's not going to get as bad. Like the it's going to stop raining soon. And then it gets to your knees and you're like, okay, well, I mean, I'm still here. I might as well tough it out. You know, I've I've already made it this far into the water. I've been here for so long. What's the point in even leaving? And then it gets to, you know, your shoulders. And at this point, you got to go to a higher level. But now you have no ability to leave. Now, because of your previous decisions, you found yourself in a spot where you've made irreversible damage to yourself and to your home. &gt;&gt; But it all started from neglect, &gt;&gt; from downplaying, &gt;&gt; from taking lightly the hurricane. &gt;&gt; You know, I find that that is what falling away really is. And it's not a surprise as someone who's done it myself, it is not a surprise when someone falls away. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you find yourself in a spot to where now you're criticizing, you find yourself in a spot to where you're doubting and even where you're like, I don't really think I want to be a part of this. That wasn't just a single event, a leap. That was a gradual walking steps of neglect. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Steps of carelessness. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Steps of taking your walk with God lightly. &gt;&gt; Come on. And in each of those steps is an intentional decision. And the Bible says to do the opposite. To pay careful attention. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To pay close attention. You know, are there parts of your walk with God right now that you're taking light of? &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Are there parts of your walk with God that you are neglecting? And I find it always starts with things that maybe are more debatable. Maybe there are things that if we we compare ourselves to other people doing constantly. things like Leon mentioned contribution. It's easy to take maybe contribution lightly because you compare yourself to others. It's like, well, there's some people that give a lot, there's some people that don't give. And so, because there's people in both ranges, let me just pick the one that I want to be in rather than the one that I know I could give according to what I have. You know what? It could be even singing, you know, and the room is pretty loud enough. There's speakers, you know, I I don't really feel the need to sing. What is one more voice anyways? Wow. &gt;&gt; Does my voice really matter when it comes to singing? &gt;&gt; It could be fellowship, you know, do what is one less presence there? If just one person is not at midweek, one person's not at church, what if if just if I don't come to just, you know, just a few of them, would anyone really ever notice? &gt;&gt; And we draw back in these convictions because what happens is we're not focused on Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not focused on his power. We're focused on ourselves and we're focused on man. Wow. &gt;&gt; And this neglect is completely man focused. &gt;&gt; But we have to go back to the very first thing was focus on Christ's power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Focus on who he is. Paying careful attention. Uh it says in uh well it says in verse 5 actually let's keep reading. It says, \"For he has not subjected to angels the world to come that we are talking about, but someone somewhere has testified. What is man that you remember him or the son of man that you care for him? You made him lower than the angels for a short time. You crowned him with glory and honor and subjected everything under his feet. For in subjecting everything to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. As it is, we do not yet see everything subjected to him. But we do see Jesus made lower than the angels for a short time, so that by God's grace he might taste death for everyone, crowned with glory and honor, because he suffered death. For in bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was entirely appropriate that God for whom and through whom all things exist should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, saying, \"I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters. I will sing hymns to you in the congregation. Again, I will trust in him. And again, here I am with the children God gave me. You know, if you are paying careful attention to the message of salvation that Jesus is Lord that was first given you, Jesus is not ashamed to call you his brother or sister. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? that you know we get so focused on man but meanwhile Jesus is literally trying to cheer us on &gt;&gt; like focus on me he is standing before God our father in heaven saying look look at my bro look at my sis look at look at them go and and that that is why we do what we do &gt;&gt; because of him and it says that it is it was fitting or some say that it is entirely appropriate that Jesus was made perfect through his suffering. Which is interesting because we just learned that he was superior to angels. How is someone that is superior to angels somehow still having to go through a process of perfection if they were already great? &gt;&gt; And he did it for our sake. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He did it for us. And he was made perfect through his suffering. You know, there is no such thing as a painless lesson. no such thing. If it was painless, that means you didn't learn the right thing on &gt;&gt; or you didn't learn anything. &gt;&gt; Or if there is no pain, then it wasn't even a lesson. You know, there is no such thing as a painless lesson. Christ was made perfect through his suffering. You know, I find this to be the equation. If you're alive, if you're a disciple, and if you are suffering, God is making you perfect. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That is the equation. &gt;&gt; Yes. So all of us here are alive. Many of us here are disciples and a lot of us go through suffering. &gt;&gt; And guess what that means? God is making you perfect. &gt;&gt; That that the job is not done. &gt;&gt; That that he has decided, you know what? There's still some refining to be done. &gt;&gt; And you know what? And I believe they could do it. And if I didn't believe it, they wouldn't be here. So if you are here and if you're a disciple and you're going through suffering, God believes that you can make it through. That's right. &gt;&gt; And guess what? Jesus is cheering you on. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; You know, I think we we have to truly believe that. We have to truly believe that Jesus is unashamed to call us brothers and sisters, you know, and maybe this is it. Maybe some of us we're we're thinking about it. We're like, I don't know. Do do I really believe it? Do I really think I can actually endure this kind of suffering? Is this the kind of suffering that I want to push myself through? Whether it be loss, whether it be trials, whether it be concern for your future. Is this really what I want to put myself through right now? But Jesus is still cheering you on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; he's unashshamed. And you know, I think it was so amazing even what Liz was sharing uh about this fe this fear, this feeling of, you know, I I could give into my failings. I I I could give into fear. Even Sior was sharing about that like I could give in that. We all have those same thoughts. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I could give into what I think and what I feel, but let me choose to focus on Christ, &gt;&gt; the deity of him, and the fact that though he was great, far superior than any angel, that he gave us the example of being made perfect through suffering &gt;&gt; and that I can do it as well. You know in uh verse 14 when you keep reading it says now since the children have flesh and blood in common Jesus also shared in these so that through his death he might destroy the one holding the power of death that is the devil and free those who were held in slavery all their lives by the fear of death. For it is clear that he does not reach out to help angels but to help Abraham's offspring. Therefore, he had to be like his brothers and sisters in every way so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in matters pertaining to God to make atonement for the sins of the people. For since he himself has suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted. Yeah, &gt;&gt; what an incredible passage. &gt;&gt; How Jesus had to be like us in every way so that he could advocate for us &gt;&gt; so he could show us how to do it, how to endure through suffering. You know the part that I also really like in verse 15 how it says that um Jesus well verse 14 that he died of course for our atonement. We know that he died for the forgiveness of sins, but it also says that he did it to free those who were held in slavery all their lives to the fear of death. &gt;&gt; And is that not true? When as some when you are not a disciple, you never know when that time's going to come and you don't know what's going to happen to you. &gt;&gt; But as a disciple, you don't fear death anymore. And I think it's important as a disciple, we choose not to fear death. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right? &gt;&gt; Disciples don't fear death. &gt;&gt; And I think even sometimes we underestimate maybe if we've been a disciple for a year, two years or a few decades, you know, the that that feeling of fearing death. And I remember even for one year uh before I fell away for 5 years, I came back in 2019. I remember that and I'm like, you know what? I just give up. I'm just going to go back to my old lifestyle. And I remember the very next morning after I woke up, this huge wave of fear and paranoia went over me. I was like, \"Oh, wow.\" Like if I die, I am not going to heaven. &gt;&gt; And I never thought I would feel that again. &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes as disciples, maybe we we've forgotten that feeling, which is good. That's what Jesus saved us from. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But what happens when we go back to drifting away? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. when we start to neglect our walk with God, that fear starts to creep back in. &gt;&gt; And I think what I love about this passage is that sometimes we have overcome things that we don't even realize we've overcome. &gt;&gt; I I didn't even realize how much I've overcome fear until I fell away. And I, you know, it's important to know this because when you walk with Christ, you know, you know, Leon was talking about it starts to become second nature and and then but what happens sometimes when it starts to feel like second nature, you start to make compromise. &gt;&gt; And we have to, you know, have a walk with God that we can trust in, have confidence in, but we have to always pay careful attention. &gt;&gt; We want to be second nature, but you also want to always be paying careful attention. Amen. Um, and I believe right now our our biggest threat is ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, back then here their biggest threat were people literally trying to kill and persecute the Christians. And we learned that God takes revenge on those who destroy his temple. But if no one is killing us, the only one who will destroy this temple is ourselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So right now, we are our own biggest threats. And it said that Christ has freed us from this death by the way that he died. But by the way that he lived. He gave us an example of enduring through suffering. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you know, some of us like me know what it's like to want to give in, want to give up, and we've had these different thoughts. But what's amazing is that through Christ's power and by focusing on our walk with God, not neglecting it, that we get to continue to live and to not drift away. Um, I want to close out here uh with a few different points. One, I really want to lift up Anthony and Liz. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. um they they already said uh most of what I would have already said, but they week after week, day after day, month after month, and they've talked about they've been going through this for over a year. They still come with peace in their hearts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; With joy on their face. And they're not faking it. They're very vulnerable. If you ever ask them what was going on, they're they're not trying to, you know, put it under a rug, tuck it in a bottle, cast it into the sea. like they're very open about it, but they're choosing to live according to the power that Jesus has for them. &gt;&gt; And I really love the story that Anthony shared uh last time he shared communion and how he was running on the treadmill and how that was never really done before. Like no one goes through quadruple open heart surgery and then is seen running on a treadmill a few months later. &gt;&gt; Like that is unheard of. and that the people there who have gone through very similar things and they're at this you know phys physical therapy uh location saw that and were inspired by him but no one is telling Anthony hey bro you should push yourself to over you know recover from your surgery like no no one is telling Anthony bro like you have to do more you know you got to come back full force it is literally him and God &gt;&gt; it is him and Christ if anything I'm like bro I'm not sure why you're here today you know like are you sure you're okay. You need He's like, \"No, I'm ready to go.\" Like, it's amazing what happens when Christ is your focus and not man. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we get so man focused, then we start to neglect our walk with God. &gt;&gt; But you have to reverse this. When you get so Christ focused, you can do things that inspire many people that no one has literally seen before. Doing things out out of simple motivation because of your love for Christ. You know, we have to give 100% because we have Christ as an example. &gt;&gt; Christ as an example for enduring through suffering and that he was tempted literally in every way but still endured and received a crown of glory and that even though he is perfect, he is still standing before God the Father unashamed to call us brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Even though we're not perfect. That's &gt;&gt; right. Even though we're still here striving for that, he is unashamed to advocate for us before the father. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; You know, I really hope that we can, you know, just take today, you know, we'll go through the rest of Hebrews and we'll really see this common theme of really pushing through. What do we have to focus on? What are we truly living for? And that, you know, if maybe you're thinking of, I I want to give up. I want to throw in the towel. Let's just at least finish the book of Hebrews and we can at least talk afterwards. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um but but I pray that we can take strength and courage from Jesus's example &gt;&gt; that he was perfect and made perfect but still advocates for us who are imperfect as we strive to be just like him. &gt;&gt; And that he's unashamed to call us brothers and sisters. To God be all the glory. [Music] [Laughter] [Music]",

    "transcript": "[Music] Let's turn our Bibles to Revelation chapter 21. &gt;&gt; You know, today we will close out our Ezekiel series. &gt;&gt; It's been a great run. Come on here. &gt;&gt; Uh, Revelation 21, &gt;&gt; it says in verse one, \"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. I also saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husbands.\" Then I heard loud voice from the throne of the book. God's dwelling is with humanity and he will live with them. They will be his peoples and God himself will be with them and will be their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more. Grief, crying, and pain will be no more because the previous things have passed away. Then the one seated on the throne said, \"Look, I am making everything new.\" He also said, \"Write because these words are faithful and true.\" Then he said to me, \"It is done. I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give to the thirsty from the spring of the water of life. The one who conquers will inherit these things and I will be his God and he will be my son.\" You know, you read this passage and it's quite appalling to me how God has appointed a specific day in the future. Well, all of this will be no more. It'll all be gone. And even other passages, it talks about, you know, one day the the mountains melting, the the trees burning. It's literally this will all be no more. When that happens, every tear will wipe away. Every pain, every kind of grief will be gone. And it says that if we conquer, right? And I believe Jesus is the perfect example of conquering &gt;&gt; the two things. He conquered, he conquered sin and he conquered death. and that if we can follow in his footsteps in in doing what he did, conquering sin, conquering death through him, it says that we will inherit this new creation, this water of life. &gt;&gt; You know, the this being our our last lesson in the book of Ezekiel, we're actually going to see a lot of parallels between the last two chapters of Ezekiel and the last two chapters of Revelation. And it's actually quite amazing seeing how it all plays out. And we'll see this this newness that God has created, this new city, this new way of life, this new way of worship. And we were coming off the curt the coattails a little bit of how what we saw as the temple that was being built. And so we see how God is a great designer. So the title for today's lesson is the great architects. And you know, I just realized I actually have an image. We're not going to use it now, but I totally forgot to send these to the Nebi. Let me just send these to Nebby. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We're not going to use it for a minute. &gt;&gt; Come on. Okay, let's go to Revelation 21 again. But now verse 22. And what I'm going to work backwards. Typically, I would make a point and then show scriptures that prove that point. When looking at this specific chapter in Ezekiel, Gastian in Ezekiel, I was I was so utterly confused on what it meant because there are so many different people giving it different meanings. So, I'm actually going to work backwards leading to that point, but show uh evidencing scriptures beforehand. So the first one, Revelation 21 verse 22, the Bible reads, \"I did not see a temple in it because the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its temple.\" Talking about the new city. The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it. Because the glory of God illuminates it and its lamp is the lamp. The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. Its gates will never close by day because it will never be night there. They will bring the glory and honor of the nation into it. Nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what detestable or false, but only those written in the lamb's book of life. You know, it once again is describing this this new city. And we looked at previously how the uh temple that is being described in Ezekiel 43 is not a literal temple. In the same way we want to see this city is not a physical city that is descending from the sky and we all have to fly over and live on this new city. Right? But it this city comes down and unlike the previous nations in Judaism, how they had a temple to worship in this city that is described here, there is no physical temple. That the temple itself is God. &gt;&gt; It is the land. And that there is no need for even a sun or a moon. That what illuminates the city is the light that comes from God. But we're going to hold on to this. We're going to hold on to the fact that it says in verse 22 that Christ is the temple. So just keep that in the back of your mind. Go to Hebrews chapter 9. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 9. &gt;&gt; It says in verse 11, \"But Christ has appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come in the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made of hands, that is not of this creation. He entered the most holy place once for all time, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. So the Bible here is relating to Jesus as the high priest. So in the temple worship days, there was a singular man who was the only one in charge of being within the same room as the ark of the covenant, and that was the high priest. &gt;&gt; And it's literally saying that Jesus is that high priest. So now Jesus is two things. He is the temple and he is the high priest that also enters the temple. This is very important to know. Let's go to Ezekiel 44 now. &gt;&gt; And then hopefully you guys won't have to spend as many hours as I did trying to figure this out. In Ezekiel 44, it says in verse one, the man they uh then brought me back toward the sanctuary's outer gate that faced east and it was closed. So what we've seen so far is Ezekiel is being carried along by an angel to see what Jerusalem looks like, but it is all a vision. It's not literally happening. It is all a vision. So this man is taking Ezekiel, helping him see this next vision. And here's what he sees. He says, 'The Lord said to me, \"This gate will remain closed. It will not be opened and no one will enter through it because the Lord, the God of Israel, entered through it. Therefore, it will remain closed.\" The prince himself will sit in the gate to eat a meal before the Lord. He is to enter by the way of the portigo of the gates and go out the same way. So this passage is saying that the gate will be closed because God has already entered specifically through the easter gates. So as long as God is within the temple, the eastern gate to the temple will not be open. It's cuz he is in there. And it says this interesting person and this this prince will be eating this meal within the temple. And it sounds kind of random. Why would it describe a prince eating a meal in the temple? We're not going to turn there. But in Leviticus 6 26, it says that only one person is allowed to eat a meal within the temple. Do you guys know who that is? &gt;&gt; The high priest. Okay. So, you have this prince who is actually also a high priest eating this meal in the temple. Right? Let's go to Ezekiel 46 verse one. All right. And a few things to note is that only God is allowed to enter through the eastern gate according to the past passage, right? And this this prince enters by the port, but it doesn't quite clarify which gate. This is really important because a lot of people actually argue on who this prince was. And this is why it took me so long to find out what it's even talking about. Some say this prince is actually referring to a physical man who will lead physical Israel as kind of a Davidic figure, not as a messianic figure spiritually, but kind of like a war chief. Um, but of course, you're kind of thinking like, well, is that really the case? Right? Because if the temple is spiritual, why would the leader be physical? And so, in Ezekiel 46 in verse one, I'm not getting ahead of ourselves, but we'll go back. says, \"This is what the Lord God says. The gate of the inner court that facthth east is to be closed during the six days of work, but it'll be opened on the Sabbath day and opened on the day of the new moon. The prince should enter from the outside by the way of the gates to go and stand at the gates door post while the priest sacrifices burnt offerings and those offerings will bow and worship at the gates threshold and then depart.\" Okay. So it says that the gate that is opened by which he enters is which gates? &gt;&gt; The Easter gates. So if only God enters through the eastern gates. But then you have this prince who is also able to enter through this eastern gate. This prince cannot be a physical figure. It's actually referring to God incarnate Jesus Christ. Wow. The Messiah. And uh I love this because if the prince equals Christ, but also the prince is a high priest, we're kind of getting a little bit into what we'll learn later about the the order of Melzdc. And actually uh starting next week, we're going to jump from immediately doing the Ezekiel series to starting to do a series on Hebrews. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; A little bit. Um but let's take what we know so far. So, so far what we have is that God and the lamb are the temple. The lamb is Christ. Revelation 21. We know that in our previous lesson, Ezekiel 43 says that God told Ezekiel to tell the Israelites this great description of the temple for a particular reason that they might be ashamed of their sins. &gt;&gt; But remember who is the temple? It is Christ. When we look at Christ, what should we be ashamed of our sins? Wow. And what's also amazing is that it says that this new temple, not only is Christ the temple, but he is the one who also enters the temple as a priest and a prince, meaning he has all power and authority over the temple, both spiritually and as a governing authority. Um, but this this once again, this temple is not a literal building that he's foreshadowing. Let's go to 1 Corinthians 3 &gt;&gt; and we'll piece it all together right here. &gt;&gt; It says in 1 Corinthians 3:1 16, &gt;&gt; \"Don't you yourselves know that you are God's temple &gt;&gt; and that the spirit of God lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy and that is what you are.\" Point number one, new worship in God's temple. &gt;&gt; New worship in God's temple. The Bible clearly states that you are God's temple. &gt;&gt; And it's not your own temple. You did not design the blueprints or the layouts. God had designed it long, long ago. And we just have to build it within us. We are God's temple. and into has decided to be a temple where Christ can come in and have his throne placed right there &gt;&gt; within us. And if God, he's the one who drew up these blueprints, right? It says that if man destroys the temple, it says God will destroy him. I think the literal sense is actually taking it very physically in that if someone uh attacks us and persecutes us to the point of death, God will avenge us. I believe that that is the immediate application of the scripture. But I also think that there is talking about a deeper spiritual thing here kind of what was saying both the physical and the spiritual. Um, and that if you're still living and your temple is destroyed, that can only be destroyed by one person, and that is you. &gt;&gt; And so, not only if someone obviously assaults you for the sake of Christ, do they destroy the temple, but if you yourself decide to destroy it? And how did they destroy the temple in what we see in Ezekiel? Because of their sin. You know, our own sin can destroy the temple that we built for God. &gt;&gt; You know, even going a step further, not just that we each individually are God's temple, but we as a collective, his church, are a singular temple. &gt;&gt; We are all God's temple. You know, the church is us, but also the church is you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. As an individual. You know, since I I was young, one thing I've always wrestled with is this idea of, you know, the person I should look out for the most is myself. And that as long as I look out for numer I'll be okay. And I remember when I even I first studied the Bible didn't last very long because it was still all about me. And then I walked away from God. Then it almost felt like that that urge the simple nature to only look out for myself only amplified um knowing that I wasn't with God and I decided to dedicate my entire life just living for myself and even to a point to where I developed a deep apathy towards even my family members. I remember um I remember actually this very specific moment when I fell away. I used to always uh cry whenever my mom cried. I didn't even watch a movie. I'm like, \"This movie is really I look over crying tears.\" But I I remember when I fell away and my mom was crying, I shed no tears because this deep apathy came over me out of my own decision. And uh fast forward 5 years later, I I got baptized during CO. &gt;&gt; And you know during CO my apathy it was I I never fully dealt with it in the sense of we were still meeting like over Zoom and whatnot. I lived in New York where the all the restrictions were very high. &gt;&gt; And so even though I I said I repented, I never fully went back to being around people yet. And so when co was kind of wrapping up and everyone was calling, hey, we're meeting back in person. We're having, you know, church in person and midweek in person, all this stuff in person. I had to really learn mentally I have to really kill this part of myself. &gt;&gt; I can't allow this this selfish unloving nature continue to live. &gt;&gt; And you know, in different ways, God had allowed me to really crucify that. About 1 year and 9 months into my disciplehip, I got married. [Applause] incredible wife and I have to I have to crucify this pardon for myself. &gt;&gt; And then about one year and one month in the marriage I get and even more it's still burden to crucify this part of me but I just know it cannot continue to live. Uh because if I choose to give into my sinful nature of let me just do what matters to me most. Let let me just do I guess I'll put it different way. Let me just look out for myself only. Let me only care about myself. And if I do that, I not only destroy my life, I destroy my wife's life &gt;&gt; and I destroy my daughter's life. And the Bible says when you build a tower unable to finish, I I I partially ruin the chances of those who are on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that as a disciple of Jesus as a temple of God and being a part of a larger temple, it is not just my life that I'm responsible over. &gt;&gt; You know, if you are a disciple of Jesus Christ, you are not the only temple that you should be taking care of. Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; You know, if you are a part of his church, &gt;&gt; if you are a part of God's temple, God's household, his family, then what you do or choose not to do, believe it or not, bears weight on everyone else's lives. &gt;&gt; And what we can do is we can sign ourselves to think that I'm an insignificant piece. you know, oh, I've been living here for a few months, maybe a few years, or I've been lacking my faith, or I'm stuck in this sense. And we start to think that our weight on what we do or not do in other people's lives means nothing. That I'm just a small piece that if I was taken out, then it the church would go on. That is not true, right? &gt;&gt; And we cannot deceive ourselves into believing in Christ. You know, I think, you know, uh, just kind of thinking about this more, you know, we have to really consider the church and the church's needs as much as we consider our own. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I believe that's what the Bible calls us to do. &gt;&gt; And I really want to urge us, don't do what you think others shouldn't do if you know is wrong. &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we condemn ourselves by doing something we know is wrong, but we think others won't follow in our footsteps, &gt;&gt; right? But once again, you are the church and as a whole we are a church. &gt;&gt; You know, people say, \"Well, the church does this, the church doesn't do that.\" Well, you're the church. &gt;&gt; You make up the church as an individual. &gt;&gt; You know, another thing is that we have to take responsibility of the needs of those in the church, especially spiritual needs. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and that if we see another brother or sister do something wrong, then hey, you know what? Even if someone else saw it, I'm going to pretend like I'm the only person that saw it, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to address that personally. &gt;&gt; Maybe you see a brother, sister need encouragement. But even if you think, oh, maybe someone else might get it. I can talk to someone else. I may not be the best person. I'm in this different situation. No, take it upon yourself as if you were the only person that sees this to encourage that person. You know, we really have to take responsibility over one another. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We are God's temple. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if we go back to Ezekiel, &gt;&gt; the the rest of the chapter, I'm going to kind of skip through a lot of it here. Uh the rest of the chapter uh talks about how God reinstates his priesthood that he originally wanted. And what happened was is you see um between verse 6 to verse 14 of chapter 44 that the people who were meant to be priests were supposed to be descendants of Aaron uh Moses' brother. But not only were they not descendants of Aaron, they weren't even Levites, they were foreigners. they started to allow foreigners to reign as priests during the days of the old covenants. And so God is completely wiping all this out. And uh I think it's powerful to know that if God wants his temple to be served, he wants it to be served right. &gt;&gt; That if God drafted the blue the blueprints, it doesn't mean that well I can he made it. I can just function however I want within God's temple. You know, God has not only made the blueprints, but he made the plans of certainty. &gt;&gt; Uh chapter 45, uh it talks about how the land is divided amongst the different tribes. It specifically kind of narrows down to one tribe split in half and the rest on their own. And so it says the priests get a tribal aotment. It says the Levites get a tribal aotment which were I guess you can if the priests serve the temple the Levites you can consider like janitors of the temple and then it says the Israelites actually altogether just had one plot of land but once again it's not physical lands and in in the sense actually in Joshua when they enter the promised land each tribe was given land in accordance to how many people were in their tribe. So here we're all just given one plot of land no matter you know how much people weigh your tribe. And if this were technical and physical and real then some tribes actually wouldn't be able to kiss. Um of course is actually a spiritual illusion of course. Um and the the symbolism in that is that because they all have they all share one land. They all have the same size. It goes back to the parable that Jesus talks about how he hires men at different hours. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they all receive the same wage. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So this idea of every tribe receiving the same size land is actually alluding to that we all have the same inheritance in Christ. Um and it's quite powerful imagery. Uh and we want to go towards the end of chapter 45 in verse 22 and see one thing here. It says on that day the prince will provide a bull as a sin offering on behalf of himself and all the people of the land will stop there. So once again this this debate on whether this prince is a a physical ruler over physical Israel or is this prince talking about Christ? You know, one argument they look at here, excuse me, is that it said that he offers a sacrifice for himself and say, well, it can't be Jesus if he offers a sacrifice for himself. But it's actually talking about a greater symbolism here. And I wouldn't I have never done this before, but I'm going to assign those who want to. Amen. You don't have to who want to read the chapter of Leviticus chapter 16. Let's go. &gt;&gt; And it's literally called the day of atonements. &gt;&gt; So when it says right here that the priest offered the prince offered a sacrifice for himself, what happened was Leviticus chapter 16, we know how Aaron's sons um uh burned and on an unauthorized fire &gt;&gt; and it says that God just smoked them on the spot. &gt;&gt; Well, right after that, it says that God talks to Moses. Moses tells Aaron the father that hey go present an offering for you all your family and the entire Israelites as a day of atonements. &gt;&gt; So this concept here is though it's saying that oh does the prince of his Jesus out offer sacrifices for himself is actually once again proving that this man is both a prince and a high priest because only the high priest would do that everybody else. And so it kind of makes you think, wait a minute, so Jesus's sacrifice, that is the day of atonements. &gt;&gt; You know, I talked about leaders meeting. It'd be so cool to do a Leviticus series. &gt;&gt; Yes, I heard this. &gt;&gt; They're like, \"Yeah, Leviticus excited.\" And but in Leviticus, literally every chapter has symbolism to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It is the coolest thing. And when you dig into it, it might seem mundane. I remember my first times, I'm like, what is going on here? But when you keep reading and you look at all the things happening, you're like, this is incredible. &gt;&gt; And I believe this is one of those things. And uh this idea of the priest and high priest like I was saying refers to the order of Melzdc which Melzdc was a priest and a king that Abram I believe was uh sacri uh gave tithes to this man who wasn't even of Hebrew descent but it said that Abram both gave tithes and bowed down to him and is this idea that you see later on way later in Hebrews that Jesus is in the order both pricks and priests. Wow. So that's why you see this whole concert play together. And I think it'd be actually amazing once we do this uh Hebrew series, see it all fit together. &gt;&gt; I think it would be really cool. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Um okay, we'll keep going here. So Ezekiel 46 I'm skip. It says between verses 1 to 15, uh it talks about uh sacrifices happening and Jesus um is why it's talking about the prince making these sacrifices is because Jesus the prince is our final sacrifice. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it talks about this Sabbath and new moon. And what what kind of stands out here that the Israelites had many festivals but here it only names two. And both of these festivals are symbolic of individual things. the Sabbath which we know is talking about rest and this new moon is in the name is talking about renewal. So there's this concept that in Christ there is both both rest and renewal which is quite amazing. uh verse 16 to 18 uh it talks about how land is uh transferred or divided in a sense um and it it highlights God's justice because he'll never exploit anybody and meaning he won't take the land from you what's quite incredible is when the Israelites originally asked for a king they asked Samuel for a king is that God said that he will take your sons and put them in battle that he will take their lands he will tax you and that you don't want to keep. He's going to take from you. But then you have this prince who is not going to take from you. He is a perfect prince who will not exploit you. And lastly in chapter 46 between verses 19 to 24 uh it just gives an emphasis on holiness and order. And you see throughout these next uh the previous two chapters 45 and 46 that God wants a separation between the sacred and the profane that we can't just bring whatever we want into God's temple. Uh now we're going to actually read uh chapter 47. Come on. &gt;&gt; It says in verse one, uh, then the then he brought me back, right? The man that's carrying Ezekiel's hands and visions. He brought it back to the entrance of the temple, and there was water flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east. For the temple from from the temple faced east, the water was coming down from under the south side of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. Next, he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around the outside of the outer gate that faced east. There was the there the water was trickling from the south side. As the man went out east with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a third of a mile and led me through the water. It came up to my ankles. Then he measured off a third of a mile and led me through the water and came up to my knees. He measured off another third of a mile and led me through the water and it came up to my waist again. Then he measured off a third of a mile, and it was a river that I could not cross on foot, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed on foot. He asked me, \"Do you see this, son of man?\" Then he led me back to the bank of the river. When I had returned, I saw a very large number of trees along both sides of the riverbank. He said to me, \"This water flows out of the eastern region and goes down toward the arrow. When it enters the sea, the sea of foul water, the water of the sea becomes fresh. Every kind of living creature that swarms will live wherever the river flows. And there will be a huge number of fish because this water goes there. Since the water will become fresh, there will be life everywhere the river goes. Fishermen will stand beside it from Angetti to Enland. This uh these will become places where nets are spread out to dry. Their fish will consist of many different kinds like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea. Yet it swarms and marshes will not be healed. They will be let left for salt. All kinds of trees providing food will grow along both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit will not fail. Each month they will bear fresh fruit because of the water comes from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be used for eating and their leaves for healing. &gt;&gt; Uh Debbie, can you pull up the uh picture with there's three different images? &gt;&gt; Debbie, &gt;&gt; it's kind of it's a little small. Can you guys tell what that what that is a little bit? The top one is the temple. Uh we actually looked at that picture uh last Sunday. Uh the the middle one is the direction and how the river is flowing east and then the bottom one shows the different levels. I think they're tech I think most Bibles just say a thousand cubits um between and how it gets deeper and deeper each level and how there's trees growing along the side of each bank. You can keep it up for now. Um point number two, healing for the nations and you know we see the different uh levels of death. Maybe I should go to the other image where we zoomed in on the bottom one. Um, and now we actually see there are uh different levels of depth and it is a river. Who here has ever tried to swim across a river? &gt;&gt; But not a lazy river, like an actual river. Okay. So I I remember when uh my my family and I we were in Nepal and there was this river that it might have it was but you couldn't see through it not even like a millimeter. It was just pure tur but my so I tried to swim across this river and the the the width of the river wasn't very long. It was probably from this chair to that chair. Like that's about the width of the river. And you know, my mom was like, \"There's alligators. You don't want to go in there. You don't know what's in there. She's scared of anything that like breathe that isn't human, you know.\" Um, and but but the the tour guide wasn't saying that. He he he was saying you don't want to go in there cuz as short as it is, you would drown halfway there. I was like, \"Really? It doesn't look like it's going that fast.\" Don't trust me. And people have drowned trying to cross. Basically, it's probably about like maybe 20 ft across. People have trapped and and I didn't fully get what he was saying until we got on the boat across the river and essentially this was the entrance point was up here. The boat we took was about maybe 20 30 yards this way and all we did was go straight up and then slowly we made it to this point. That's how strong the current of the river was. that we just went straight up and it took us there and they have this perfect timing because it's done so many different times and you know a river you can't actually really not a lazy one a river you can't actually swim across um and it I like this example because with the current of this river if you're ankle deep maybe it's like swaying you a little bit but you can still move your feet can move a bit but if it's knee deep you know maybe your feet are starting to drag. If it's like in sand and it's kind of carrying you a little bit, but you can still walk, you can pick up your feet. Once it gets to, you know, about waist deep, you know, you're kind of playing with fire there cuz if if something hits your leg and you know, capsizes you and, you know, you go down and who knows if you're really able to get back up, but you know, if you're able to, you might be able to stand your ground. But it says the the final death, it says you weren't even able to walk it &gt;&gt; and that you couldn't stand on the the the bed of the river, that you would have to swim. And this concept of trying to swim through a river, it you would drown. &gt;&gt; You you would not survive trying to swim a river. Um but this river is actually not a bad river because it says that it it brings life. It literally goes into the sea and then it takes this this terrible dirty sea it brings it life. Even specifically it says that it takes foul water and it makes it become fresh water. &gt;&gt; And it says everywhere that the river goes that there will be life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I'm thinking about this. It's like what do the different levels the different depths of the the river really mean? It's like, well, if the river isn't bad, you actually want to be in the river because it gives life. You know, water a lot of times it actually symbolizes the spirit in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; What what is kind of leading me to believe what I think the passage you're talking about is that once you're at a certain depth in the river, you are no longer in control of the river. &gt;&gt; And your life is at the mercy of the river. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so I actually believe this is talking about the more control you give up, the more healing you will receive. &gt;&gt; And that you know, you still have a level of, you know, I can I can pick up my feet. I can move my legs. I can move my hips. But once you're at a point where you cannot walk, you are at the mercy of God's river. &gt;&gt; You have to give up complete control. If you want proper healing, &gt;&gt; I think many people can share these stories how much they they want to keep a little bit, but then God test them and they fail. You know, be like, you know, maybe I can do this in my walk with God and they try it and they fail. There's consequences. But once you give up complete control, you will find complete healing &gt;&gt; and there will be life. &gt;&gt; You know, I really love how it talks about these streets. And I referenced earlier how there's many parallels between these last few chapters and Revelation. Let's go there. Let's go to Revelation 22. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Revelation 22 and verse one. Then he showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the city's main street. The tree of life was on each side of the river, bearing 12 kinds of fruit, producing its fruit every month. It's literally the same thing. The leaves of the tree are for healing the nations &gt;&gt; and there will no longer be any curse and the throne of God and of the lamb will be in the city and his servants will worship him. Point number two, healing for the nations. What is this really talking about here? Why is this river flowing from the temple into the sea? And it's so that every everywhere the river touches will have life. &gt;&gt; You know, so far we've been looking at all that's been happening in uh Ezekiel from announcing this exile, this slavery that is soon to come and announcing the the temple, the pride and joy of the Israelites soon to be destroyed. There's blood on the streets there. There is craziness happening. There are these visions that literally make Ezekiel want to die. Amidst all of that, it leads to this very final point where God has this plan. &gt;&gt; And this plan is for world evangelism. &gt;&gt; World evangelism is God's dream. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It is not man's dream. &gt;&gt; And the question is, how deep in that river will you go? How much control over your life will you give up to see this world saves? &gt;&gt; Let's go to Ezekiel 48 and we'll close out here. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 48 in verse 35. Once again, we're talking about this new city in Revelation. It says the perimeter of this city will be 6 milesi and the name of the city from that day on will be the Lord is there. You know in closing out here we see how there has always been a plan from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God knew all this was going to happen but he had this he has this great plan. He has this great dream that one day everyone will know that the city in which he resides, the temple as a person and as a collective where he wants to live, that one day the world will know that God is there among them. You know, God always has a plan. You have to believe that that God always has a plan &gt;&gt; and that everyone everywhere it is God's desire that they may be heroes. Why? Because when they have this healing that comes directly from the source, directly from Christ, then everyone will know that there's without a doubt that God is there. &gt;&gt; And I think that we have to as people bring this healing &gt;&gt; that it can be said without a doubt that God is the most healed. &gt;&gt; That that God resides in your life &gt;&gt; that that Christ is at the throne of your hearts. But we have to believe that this dream is our own as well. &gt;&gt; That God has this dream to see the world saved. And we have to make it our dream as well. &gt;&gt; But not because we have to, but because we want to. &gt;&gt; Not not because we got to, but because we get to. &gt;&gt; It is so powerful to live within God's dream. And even if you're a disciple right now, you are part of that dream. Wow. &gt;&gt; And you have to carry out that dream. Yes. You know, we're still trying to see it complete, but you're still in God's dream currently. &gt;&gt; We have to believe this. And if we carry out healing for the rest of the nations, it will be known that God is here. It's a God. [Music] [Laughter] [Music]",

    "summary": "This sermon concludes the Ezekiel series by drawing parallels between Ezekiel's visions of a new temple and Revelation's vision of a new heaven, new earth, and New Jerusalem. The speaker argues that the new temple and its practices are spiritual, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is both the Temple, the High Priest, and the Prince. Ultimately, believers themselves, individually and collectively as the church, are God's temple, called to live holy lives and engage in world evangelism, allowing God's life-giving 'river' to bring healing to the nations.",

    "transcript": "[Music] So far, right, Ezekiel uh has and can be split into four sections. And you may write these down, but you don't have to. Um chapters 1 to three, we talk about the commission of Ezekiel, right? How he received this great vision. He basically died, you know, out of just great awe, but then God put him back up and said, \"Now go preach.\" Right? Um and chapters 4 to 24 uh God commissions Ezekiel, right, to talk about the judgment that he has against his people Judah. And after he goes from chapter 4 to 24 all about this judgment against God's own people, you know, we talked about how these onlookers, these persecutors, you may say, were like, \"Haha, look what God is doing to you. You're so bad.\" And then for the next basically 10 chapters, God's like, I'm coming at at you guys, too. Um, chapters 25 to 32. Right now, we're in the middle of the last section, which you could call the restoration of Israel. And basically, you have 32 chapters of just judgment of signs, symbols, and prophecies of what God has to say concerning his own people. But he reserves the best for last. talks about restoration and what will happen when God's people come back together. &gt;&gt; And I think it's important to know talking about this restoration that this has actually been predicted since Moses. If you go to Deuteronomy chapter 30 that the chapter is dedicated to how God talks about what he knows they will do and what the exile will be literally 900 years before it happens. So though there is a restoration, God comes back and he's one with his people, we have to understand that God actually never abandoned them. This was all a part of his great plan. And so because I would say he technically never abandoned him, we can't necessarily call it a comeback. So we're going to call today's lessons uh lesson don't call it a comeback. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't call it a comeback. And I might throw in a few different rap lyrics here and there just be just just because I don't know what inspired me last night, but amen. Uh point number one is only God knows the end. &gt;&gt; Only God knows the end. Let's go to Ezekiel 38. Today we're going to cover uh chapters 38 up to 43. Ezekiel chapter 38. It says in verse one, &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; the word of the Lord came to me, son of man, face Gog of the land of Magog, the chief priest of Mech and Tubal, prophesy against him and say, this is what the Lord God says. Look, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Mash and Tubal. I will turn you around and put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with all your armory including horses and riders who are all splendidly dressed in a huge assembly arms with large and small shields. All of them brandishing swords. Persia, Kush and Put are with them. All of them with shields and helmets. Goomer with all its troops. Beth Togar Toar Toggarma with the remotest parts of the north along with all its truth troops. many peoples are with you. Jump to verse 14. Therefore, prophesy son of man and say to Gog, this is what the Lord God says. On that day, when my people Israel are dwelling securely, remember that dwelling securely, will you not know this and come from your place in the remotest parts of the north? You and many peoples with you who are all riding horses, a huge assembly, a powerful army. You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud covering the lands. It will happen in the last days, God, that I will bring you against my land so that the nations will know me when I demonstrate my holiness through you in their sights. You know, this passage is actually one of the, if not, I would argue the most debated prophecies in the whole Bible in terms of what is it talking about? Who is Gog? What is Magog? So Gog is supposed to be this king and Magog is the land that he rules over. And God is literally saying, I will pull you by hooks in the mouth to not like just judge you, but I'm going to cause you to go against my people who are sec who are dwelling securely in my own lands. And that when you do this, he says at the very end that I will uh show and demonstrate my holiness through the sight of all the nations. And I I'm going to try to go through briefly the different interpretations that people have on this passage. And I think it's important to know this that uh there are many ways people try to interpret the Bible. And I actually think going back to what I mentioned last Sunday, it's fine if people have different opinions on what it's talking about here. But what we're going to look at are the blatant facts. regardless of what people's interpretations are, we have to agree on the the basic facts and scriptures revolving around this passage itself. And so, but even if you have a whole different, I guess, concepts, we have to agree on what the Bible fundamentally says. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, one of the uh most common, we're going to look at uh uh what people say from a Jewish perspective, but also a Christian perspective, right? This is important to know. uh one is from the Jewish perspective is how people look at this passage and say okay at one point in time there are going to be nations if not every nation all gathered against Israel and it's going to be an act this is not symbolic but literal that Gog and Magog is a literal king from the north gathering other northern kingdoms to attack Israel and they look at a passage like Psalm 118:10 you don't have to go there but it literally says All nations will oppose me, but I will triumph because of God. Right? And so, Jews don't believe that Jesus is the Messiah, of course, but they believe that when this whole thing actually happens, that is when the true Messiah will step in. So, that's who they're really waiting for. Uh another interpretation is during the medieval times between uh 1,00 to300 AD um there were huge persecutors of the Jewish people which were uh uh the Romans and the Muslims and so they believe that maybe these people are Gog and Magog because these people come from around the north maybe they're our opposers. uh another uh interpretation uh in Jewish mysticism called uh cabal cabalistic uh basically they don't view any of this as literal that it is all basically yes a messiah will come but it's actually this go and magog is an internal conflict within the souls of every person and that when there is a great evil within the majority of people then that is when god will step in and provide a messiah in a sense uh there the Christian perspectives, right? And this is how people look at this passage. And why this is important is because there are New Testament passages that talk on things like this. So there's the preacherist view, which basically means that they believe that Ezekiel was writing about current time events, that this prophecy was actually happening in the moment, that he's not talking about a far future, that all of this would happen in Ezekiel's lifetime essentially. and that Gog and Magog represent uh Babylon, the Meo Persians, or the Cyians. The amillennial view uh views this as not a literal nation, that Israel doesn't represent a literal nation, but just God's people in general, as we've mentioned before, that Israel means God's people, and that there will be a great uprising and then a final judgment, kind of like what you see in the book of Revelation. Um, but another Christian view actually sides with the Jewish perspective of that it is still talking about literal Israel and that you have people rising up against it. Um, and so actually people who have this point of view believe that this is happening right now, funny enough. Um, and that literally we're in the times of like Gog and Magog, which we're not going to get into. Um, and some people similar to the Jewish mysticism believe that it is all a spiritual allegory. But this all has a reason why I'm actually talking about this. Go to Revelation chapter 20. &gt;&gt; We're going to do a little Bible study. &gt;&gt; And uh this will probably be my first time preaching on esquetology. &gt;&gt; E esquetology just means the study of end times theology in the Bible. And like I said, I think it's actually okay if people have different opinions, but we have to agree on the basic facts of what it's talking about. So Romans chapter 20 uh in verse 6 it says sorry not Romans sorry Revelation Revelation 20 and verse 6 it says blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection the second death has no power over them but they will be priests of God and of Christ and they will reign with him for a thousand years so that is the millennium that they're talking about verse seven when the thousand years are completed Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle. Their number is like the sand of the sea. You know, this if you know the Jewish perspective doesn't look at this because of course they only believe in the Old Testament, but this is the only other time Gog and Magog are mentioned in the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; It's here in the book of Revelation. So, you literally get the okay, it's it is talking about something to do with the end times, right? Um, and I I find this important because take any prophecy, any interpretation, right? You look it up, you try to study it, you look at what people say, and you're like, \"Wow, there's so many different interpretations of these things. How do I know what is right? How do I know what to pick?\" Right? And especially when it comes to the end times, you're like, \"Well, some people say it's happening right now. Like, is it literally h is Jesus going to come back in like a few months?\" Right? People actually dwell on these thoughts and I think it's important to talk about them relatively. Let's go to Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; let's do a little Bible stud. &gt;&gt; And so now if anyone ever asked you maybe some questions on revelation, you can show them these patterns. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Matthew 24 and verse one, it says, \"As Jesus left and was going out of the temple, his disciples came up and called his attention to its buildings. He replied to them, \"Do you see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here on another that will not be thrown down.\" While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately and said, \"Tell us when these things will happen and what is the sign of your coming in the end of the age.\" So Jesus is walking with his disciples out of the temple and basically he turns to them and says, \"Hey, all of this will get destroyed. This temple that you see, it'll all be turned upside down, right?\" And they ask them, \"Of course, when what when is this great destruction going to happen?\" And that's the big question we always ask ourselves about the end times, right? Like when is it going to happen? Let's go to verse 29. Same chapter 24 of Matthew. Verse 29. It says, Immediately after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shed its light and uh the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then the sign of the son of man will appear in the sky and then all the peoples of earth will mourn and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. He will send out his angels with a loud trumpet and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of the sky to another. So Jesus towards the end right because they ask him this question when is this all coming? He describes this great tribulation, this great war, this great havoc happening to all these people around them. And towards the very end of all of this destruction, right, he literally says the son of man will be coming on the clouds of heaven with great power. He is talking about his second coming. You know, Jesus came the first time, right? I mean, technically, I mean, we're not going to call his resurrection the second time, right? But here, he's talking about the second time of him coming on the clouds of heaven. But he clarifies what he's talking about and when he's talking about in verse 32 says, \"Learn this lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near. In the same way, when you see all these things, recognize that he is near at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away. So in the first few verses Jesus clearly states that he is coming back. But here he gives the time frame and the time frame is this current generation that he's talking about. So actually Jesus's second coming was during the lifetime of some of the apostles. And let's talk about this right. So we have the book of revelation written around uh 90 AD. The temple which he's referring to that's what they asked they asked him this question when is this temple when is this all getting destroyed happened in 70 AD. So John who wrote the book of revelation witnessed the temple being destroyed by commander Titus of the Roman army. And so it people look at these passages on the end times, but I think it's important to know that actually a lot of it already happens &gt;&gt; during the destruction of the temple in 70 AD. In fact, it only happened around 35 to 40 years after Jesus already resurrected and ascended. &gt;&gt; Like literally within 30 to 40 years. And you know the the reason that I I think John actually wrote about the destruction of the temple and these end times being fulfilled because he wrote about it in the past tense but in apocalyptic language. It was to assure the disciples that all of this mass destruction is all according to God's plan. Because we see in the book of Ezekiel and if you've read the book of Daniel, I mentioned the book of Deuteronomy. this great destruction, this massive end to this whole way of living with with the temple and the temple lifestyle and the priests. But John writes, \"Hey, all of this is happening according to God's plan. Th this is not out of the picture for God. God knows that this will happen and this is finally happening right now that we can see the the induction of truly the new covenant.\" Amen. And the end of the old covenant. But there there's a purpose to all of this, right? because there's still technically one prophecy left. There is technically one singular prophecy that has not been fulfilled throughout the Bible. And let's look at verse 36 &gt;&gt; right after that says now concerning right now concern. So he's Jesus now switches focus. Right now concerning that day and hour, no one knows, neither the angels of heaven nor the son except the father alone. As the days of Noah were, so the coming of the son of man will be. For in those days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving marriage until the day Noah boreed the ark. They didn't know until the flood came and swept them all away. This is the way of the coming of the son of man will be. So we didn't read the uh all that happened before this but we know that he described war, destruction and death. And then he says this will all happen in your generation. He switches focus and says now the day and hour no one knows. And we know he's talking about two different things because when he describes the day and hour no one knows, he doesn't give any sort of precursor, &gt;&gt; no level of destruction or anything. The only destruction he describes is in the moment when he comes back, but nothing dating leading up to it before, right? And that literally actually people will not even recognize it. People will be having fun getting married and next thing you know, like the flood, it happens. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus comes back. And uh this passage, right, like I think it's so important as disciples that we understand that we right now are still waiting for the day and hour unknown. And here's why I say this. In verse 45, it says, \"Who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household to give them food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom the master finds doing his job when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says in his heart, \"My master,\" is delayed, and starts to beat his fellow servants and eat and drinks uh eats and drinks with drunkards, that servant's master will come on a day he does not expect him. And at an hour he does not know, he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and nashing of teeth. Why is it important to understand as disciples that Jesus could come at any moment now is to recognize that the job is not done &gt;&gt; the job's not done literally Jesus says you know blessed is the servant who does what who is working &gt;&gt; when the master comes &gt;&gt; on &gt;&gt; and that the wicked servant two different servants both have been allowed to serve God one of them says well maybe he's not coming anytime soon maybe I can send it up now it's okay if my, you know, dillydally in my repentance because he's not coming tomorrow. He's not coming the next day. You know, I believe that comfortability is the true enemy of our salvation. &gt;&gt; You know, um why do I say this? Because when you you focus and your focus in especially when you become a disciple now, your focus is to be comfortable, it'll keep you from serving the Lord. And and this passage, you know, I love it because it says that the master will give the servant food at the proper time. &gt;&gt; And I think this is important because you know sometimes we want a little bit of heaven on earth right now. &gt;&gt; But truly, what is heaven? In one word, I would describe it as rest. &gt;&gt; Heaven is rest. And uh the the the Bible in Hebrews chapter 4, you know, we we we look at it how the word of God cuts you. Verses before that, it describes heaven as our true rests. &gt;&gt; And I believe of course it is important to rest, right? You know, but we don't rest from our works. We rest for work &gt;&gt; so we can keep on working. &gt;&gt; But we don't rest from the work of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't take breaks in our disciplehip. But instead, we take breaks so we can come back even harder. Not from disciplehip but for our disciplehip. Right? It has a purpose. You know, I think it's fine. We get our hours of sleep. You know, we have our time kicked back, laying back. Why? It's so when it's time to go, it's time to go, right? And I think sometimes we we want to have a little bit of heaven on earth. But the scripture says, \"Blessed are those who his master finds working &gt;&gt; when he comes.\" You know, we need to continue to work for the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I I think about this when it comes to trying to uh tell Anna, my daughter, what to do, right? And the reality is she's reached that point where she's like, I don't really care what you have to say, Dad. You know, it's it's the terrible twos, you know, and they're learning independence. And actually, it's good for them. It's good for them to learn independence. Amen. Um but, you know, sometimes they want too much independence. And sometimes she's doing something, playing with something dangerous, something that she's not supposed to do. One thing that she'll do is if I tell her to stop doing it, she'll slowly put it down inside of me. It's like, I know you're looking at me. You know, you heard you heard what I just said, you know. And sometimes you tell her not to do something or to do something and she like literally like throws herself on the ground like full on just like and just like plops forward or plops backward like I'm not going to do it. And she has this huge attitude but it's funny cuz whenever you like go up to her and like start tickling her like she's like like trying to like hold in her hold in her laughter. It's really funny. So she has a bad attitude but like you know she's just trying to like you know find her independence. Um, you know, one thing she started doing recently is that when she's upset, she's throwing a fit, she'll fake cry. She'll go [Applause] and she'll let out these big whales and I she she'll like force tears and literally still go like and then and she just doesn't want to do what I'm telling her to do. Amen. And and you know sometimes a as as children of God, we find it difficult to do what God asked us to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we know he wants us to do. We we even know that it's actually good for us. But we're like, God, why? Like, is there any way I can not do this? Like, you want me to share my faith? I'm tired of sharing my faith. You want me to read my Bible? I've already read it my Bible, God. Like, can is there any way I can like just just take a few steps back, right? And you know I I understand like I know sometimes it is it is difficult to do what God asks us to do. &gt;&gt; You know I I really want to uh lift up Sam. She shared communion last Sunday &gt;&gt; you know and she mentioned you know feeling hopeless and then you know feeling like you know if only I can receive some level of comfort you know or you know reassurance and then genie's like now you have to repent like that was genius solution. you want comfort and reassurance. Well, this is your reassurance when you repent, you know, then you can have reassurance. Um, but I think it's true sometimes that we want sympathy for what we go through. &gt;&gt; We want sympathy. We want comfort. We want someone that that tell us that it's fine. It's okay. But God's saying, \"No, you have to come out of it because I could come when you least expect it.\" &gt;&gt; There is no time to wait. And you know, I want you guys to ask yourself these questions. You know, have you found reasonable excuses to stop doing God's work? &gt;&gt; Have you found ways that even make sense? You might even be able to provide a solid argument for, but it keeps you from doing God's work. Also, have you been trying to have heaven a little too early? Have you been trying to have heaven a little too early? You know, it's actually important that we talk about these things. &gt;&gt; No one is going to shame you for wanting to rest. I &gt;&gt; If you feel today that maybe you're thinking of taking a break, falling away, no longer wanting to be a disciple, that's okay as long as you get open about it. &gt;&gt; You know, is don't feel ashamed. We all go through it. &gt;&gt; We all have we all think these things. We all go through these thoughts, but please talk about it. &gt;&gt; Don't hold it in. &gt;&gt; And that when we con confess our sins, we talk about what we're going through. That is where prayer starts to work. &gt;&gt; Cuz we know the good we ought to do and we pray together, God gives us life, we get strength, and we go ahead and do it. But it's also good to get open because maybe you don't know what to do &gt;&gt; and then someone can equip you with the right scriptures, &gt;&gt; uh, equip you with the right advice. And so no matter what, we have to confess. We have to be open about what is going on because, you know, whenever the day comes, whenever judgment comes and God is going to see whether or not we're going to come into heaven with him, we have to be caught doing the Lord's work. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Ezekiel chapter 40. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter 40. You know, the next three chapters straight, it just talks about measurements. &gt;&gt; You know, we talk about, you know, for one chapter, it talks about genealogies. This chapter talks about that. Literally three chapters straight. It's just giving you feet and inches and cubits, you know, and lengths and widths of just pure measurements of the temple, right? And we're going to look at some of it. Amen. I hope &gt;&gt; I hope you're excited. Um in uh verse one it says in the 25th year of our exile at the beginning of the year on the 20th day of the month no sorry the 10th day of the month in the 14th year after Jerusalem had been captured on that very day the Lord's hand was on me and he brought me there in visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and sent me down on a very high mountain on its southern slope was a structure resembling a city he brought me there and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hands. He was standing by the city gate. He spoke to me, \"Son of man, look with your eyes. Listen with your ears. I and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for you have been brought here so that I might show it to you. Report everything you see to the house of Israel.\" Now, there is a wall surrounding the outside of the temple. The measuring rod in the man's hand was six units of 21 inches. Each unit was the standard length plus three inches. He measured the thickness of the wall structure. It was 10 and 1/2 ft and his height was the same and it goes on, right? &gt;&gt; And you know, literally, like I said, it just goes on and it just talks about measurements. You know, I have this the CSB depending on your translation, it directly translated it into a way that, you know, an American reader could understand. So, mine has it in feet of inches. If you have an NIV or an NASB, it likely has it in in cubis, right? And so it's kind of cool that though it is it may not be a direct word for word translation that actually in a way makes it more understandable. Right? So in case you ever wonder what's more what's better to understand it is kind of is dependent on what you're trying to get from it. Amen. Uh we're going to break this down. Uh second point is Christ is the standard. &gt;&gt; Christ is the standard. Uh here uh let's first look at you know there's this bronze man. Uh he has a linen cord and a measuring rod and he goes throughout the description of this temple measuring every single last thing and that it creates literally a perfect imagery that commentators and theologians have been able to draft up like perfect images of this temple. And it's it's quite fascinating because after the temple was destroyed, another one wasn't built until about 20 BC and it was built by King Herod, king of the Judeans, right? And that was around 600 years after the temple was destroyed. However, it did not look like this temple described for these three chapters. I have an image that has different temples and a football in a football field. [Applause] [Music] Okay. So, this is Ezekiel's temple, right? So, in in this description, we'll look at more pictures of this. This is exactly what it's talking about. But this is the one that was around during Jesus's time. &gt;&gt; Um, this was the one that was built, right? That you hear in uh 2 Chronicles, uh, sorry, not Second Chronicles, in 2 Kings. Um, and then here's a football field for size. Here's the tabernacle that was commissioned by Moses. Uh, and like I said, it's very important to know because that temple that we see there is never built and never will be built. The one in uh by that Ezekiel is describing. And everything in this new temple is completely symbolic. And there's actually a reason why it should never be built because it's not talking about a physical temple, but the new temple that God has within us. Amen. &gt;&gt; But, you know, I think it's kind of cool because he talks some things like uh how you read in Leviticus about temple law and the and what the priest should do. And if you guys look at those descriptions, if you look at the tabernacle or if you look at the original temple in Leviticus or anything like that, it's quite fascinating because even then everything has meaning. And so I was even thinking after looking at this is maybe one day we'll do like a Leviticus series &gt;&gt; um and get get rid of the stereotype that Leviticus is boring. You know, I I've actually I I I have heard disciples say they skip Leviticus. &gt;&gt; And I was like, whoa, &gt;&gt; we are not going to do this. Amen. If you don't understand it, um you know that happens. You know, we've all we all have read the Bible before. Every single one of us looked at it at some point said, \"What are they talking about?\" Right? Um but but everything in it has deep meaning, right? But however, since Leviticus talks about the meaning of the sacrifices and what each part talks about and what it means, we're not going to go into it with this lesson, but maybe later if we do uh Leviticus series, &gt;&gt; but but well, we're going to dial it back before we get to the meaning of the temple. So, you can take that uh picture down for now. Thank you, Nebby. Um but we'll go back to talk about the first thing mentioned, which was this bronze man. This man made of bronze, right? Some say this man of bronze was an angel. Some say it is Jesus incarnate. Well, God incarnate, which is Jesus, right? An angel in Hebrew, it literally just means messenger or ambassador. So, it is an ambassador of heaven. It's not quite clear. You know, often times it describes a a perfect image of a cherubam. Some say it's a man, right? But but here it says that it's a man, right? Um, but I want to look at something that I think is kind of cool to know when it talks about an angel and what it could be referring to. Let's go to Exodus chapter 3. &gt;&gt; This I think is one of the coolest things in the Bible. Personally, Exodus chapter 3 and verse two it says, \"Then the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire within a bush.\" Okay. So when Moses sees a burning bush, it says who or what appeared to him within the bush? An angel, right? Okay, keep that in mind. Says, as Moses looked, he saw that the bush was on fire but was not consumed. So Moses thought, I must go over and look at this remarkable site. Why isn't the bush burning up? When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from the bush. Moses, Moses. There are a few different times in the Bible where the it exchanges the word angel with the word God &gt;&gt; or the word the an angel or the word the phrase the Lord. And it's quite fascinating um because you know literally Moses is the Bible says that an angel was within the bush but who speaks to him but God. There are so many instances that prove that God can and will come down in a form that we can visually see because the Bible says no one sees the father and lives, right? But we know that Jesus came and not everyone died after laying eyes on him, right? But but yet in the Old Testament there are examples just like that &gt;&gt; of God incarnate coming down in a form that we could perceive. Uh I think a cool a few cool other ones that you can uh look at is when there are three angels that appear to Abram um when the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah are about to happen. It says in that passage that three men appear, right? They tell him what to do and then later it says two angels leave and depart to Sodom and Gomorrah but one stays. And in the when it talks about you know Abraham talking to God of like well what if there is just 50 what if there's just 40 and it says the Lord it is the one angel the Lord who stayed behind and talked to Abraham. &gt;&gt; So it is God in human form. Uh, another one is Gideon when it says in Judges 6, I believe, that the the Lord is with you, um, valiant warrior. And at first it says an angel appeared to him, but then he literally says like, \"My lord, my lord.\" And there are other examples of people in Revelation specifically bowing to angels. It says, \"No, I am just an angel.\" &gt;&gt; And so, here's another example of what could be literally God incarnate, which we know the word. It is Jesus. Amen. I think one of the most obvious examples is Jacob. Jacob wrestling the man. And after he wrestled the man, it literally said, \"I have seen God face to face, &gt;&gt; which is confusing.\" Like, well, the Bible says you can't see him face to face and live. Well, of course, he's talking about the the perception of God that we can witness. Amen. And I I think, you know, that when we look at the measurements, we look at, you know, the could it be an angel, a messenger, or could it be, you know, Jesus before he ever came? Like I think it's cool when we have our quiet times in the Old Testament to hunt for these things, &gt;&gt; you know, to have a fascination of like, you know, could he be in this chapter? Oh, he wasn't in this in in my quiet time today. Maybe the next quiet time, you know, but like but the hunt for these things. Look at the measurements. Wow, this is this is so fascinating. Like God is very very specific, right? So either way, right, whether it's an angel or it is God incarnate, right? Th this messenger, this ambassador of God is going around this temple and literally measuring every last part of it. This is important because you know people like to say only God can judge me. &gt;&gt; You know God will judge you &gt;&gt; and I hope the temple you built for him has the correct measurements. &gt;&gt; And you know we look at this passage like wow God is so specific. And maybe you read it and you're like that's kind of mundane. you know, it's kind of boring. It's kind of dragging on a little bit. But I hope we fall in love with the fact that God is specific. &gt;&gt; God is very detailed, right? God is not indifferent to how we worship him. God God has a very specific standard &gt;&gt; and that we can fall in love with that. That God is a God of details. But you know that also means that we can't be to him what we want to be. We have to be to him what he has created us to be &gt;&gt; because he will measure us. Let's go to verse 13 of chapter 42 in Ezekiel. &gt;&gt; We're going to look at this a little bit more. Ezekiel chapter 42 and verse 13. It says, \"Then the man said to me, the northern and southern chambers that face the courtyard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will deposit the most holy offerings, the grain offerings, the sin offerings and guild offerings. For the place is holy.\" Once the priests have entered, they are not to go out from the holy area to the outer court until they have removed the clothes they minister in. For these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they approach the public area. Verse 20, he measured the temple complex on all four sides. It had a wall all around it, 875 ft long, 875 ft wide to separate the holy from the common. You know, it it describes these priests and very specifically it says how when the priests are before the Lord within the temple grounds, they wear certain clothes and when they're outside temple grounds, they have to wear different clothes. Why? It says in verse 20, to separate the holy from the common. This makes me think of Matthew 22. Let's go to Matthew 22. Matthew 22 uh in verse 11 it says when the king came in to see the guests he saw a man there who was not dressed for a wedding. &gt;&gt; So he said to him friends how did you get in here without wedding clothes? The man was speechless. Then the king told the attendants, \"Tie him up hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and nashing of teeth. For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" You know, being in the church, coming to the church, singing to God, going to fellowships, the singles yesterday, you know, we did some speaking at it, though I'm not single, but it was awesome. It was fun. You know, there is food. We have barbecues. It's all fun and games until God comes in and he looks at you and says, \"What are those? &gt;&gt; Why are you wearing that? I did not commission you to wear that.\" You know, I think it's important because God is specific. &gt;&gt; God has measurements. And and I think it's important to ask ourselves, you know, what are we allowing in our Christianity that God doesn't? &gt;&gt; What are we allowing to seep in there? once again that we might even make excuses for that God says toss them out. Toss them out. Whether it be hatred, bitterness, impurity, idolatry, laziness, debauchery, or are there things in our walk with God that we allow to be in there that we delay in our repentance when God is saying, \"No, if I come back and that is still there, you have to leave.\" See, it's a fun, it's a wedding party, but we have to live according to God's standard. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Ephesians chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 4. It says in verse 11 says, \"And he himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry to build up the body of Christ until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God's son, growing into maturity with the stature measured by Christ's fullness.\" You know, God gives people in his church wisdom, experience, discernment to equip everyone else to build up the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; And it also says to reach unity in the faith and knowledge of Jesus and that our maturity is literally measured by the fullness of Christ. the Christ is our standard &gt;&gt; and our maturity is being compared to him. So when we read passages like this, you know, we should think with with joy and excitement like, \"Wow, I I get to be compared to Christ. This is awesome.\" But then you you give it a bit more seconds, you're like, \"Wait a minute. I'm being compared to Christ right now. This is kind of scary.\" Like it produces these two feelings. And I really want to challenge you guys to to check yourself before you wreck yourself. &gt;&gt; I said we we'll have a few different rap lyrics in here. We have to check oursel before we wreck oursel. You know what do I think we should all be trying and striving to do is build relationships with the more mature in this church. You know, we have the Swans, we have the McGee, we have the Joneses in Kids Kingdom, we have the Echoes to really go after building relationships with those who have the experience, right? We talked about those who have maybe experienced their their third 28th birthday, right? You know, we have Eleanor, right? Like talk to these people, talk about their lives and get experience from them. Let's go back to Ezekiel 43. Ezekiel chapter 43. It says in verse one, uh, he led me to the gate, the one that faces east. And I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice sounded like the roar of a huge torrent, and the earth shone with his glory. The vision I saw was like the one I had seen when he came to destroy the city and like the one I had seen by the Chabar Canal. I fell face down. The glory of the Lord entered the temple by way of the gate that faced east. Then the spirit lifted me up and brought me to the inner court and the glory of the Lord filled the temple. You know, in chapter 10 about maybe around 18 to 20 years ago, we saw, you know, Ezekiel mentioned how God's glory left the temple. And now God is giving Ezekiel a vision of his glory coming back and re-entering the temple. Point number three, all priests, all of us are priests in God's new temple. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 10 as well. It says, \"As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. Let them measure its pattern, and they will be ashamed of all they have done. Reveal the design of the temple to them. It its layout with its exits and entrances, its complete design along with all its statutes, designs, uh, design specifications and laws. write it down in their sight so that they may observe it com its complete design and all the statutes and may carry them out. You know those in Ezekiel's time though they would never see this temple come to be he showed them God told him to show them why that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. This passage really makes me think about Christ. You know how, excuse me, how he came down, showed us the path of righteousness, of healing and salvation. Yet he died, we destroyed him because of our sins. The original temple built was destroyed because of Israel's sins. Yet of course Christ rose from the dead proving his deity, his power and his authority just like how we might see here this great temple this vast temple like wow will this really happen in our day but then of course when you just like this passage you hear of Christ's greatness how God literally came down for our sake that we could have atonement have forgiveness and why because of the sins that we've committed and he shows us, wow, look at this great glory of Christ and yet I killed him. You know, it is the same effect how he has laid out here. Show them this new temple that they can be ashamed of their iniquities. You know, there are so many parallels in the Bible about Jesus's death and this is one of them. And shame is supposed to lead us to obedience, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And why? because it is time to start building God's great temple. &gt;&gt; And I want you guys to to really dwell on this. You are not just any temple. You are not just some temple that God thought of. Maybe maybe it'll look like this, maybe it'll look like that. I don't know. They can do whatever they want. No. God since the moment you are in your mother's womb had this great blueprint laid out for you, &gt;&gt; this great future laid out for you. And it was specific. It was detailed and it is glorious. &gt;&gt; You know, he has his these charts. He has his drawing board. I can't wait for it to look like this. It's going to be amazing. But we have to build that temple. &gt;&gt; You have to start building the temple. The life that God has given you and that there is a plan that there are there is a future he has for you and there are measurements. There are details and it is time for us to build specifically according to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Christ is that measuring rod. That's right. &gt;&gt; Christ is our standard. So if we're going to build according to Christ, we have to repent of our sins. &gt;&gt; You know, we have to do his work. We have to learn to mature from those around us and be a part of God's family. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh you know, there is no time to waste. &gt;&gt; Christ is coming and we don't know when. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 26 of Ezekiel 43. And we'll close out here. Ezekiel Ezekiel 3:26 says, \"For seven days, the priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it. In this way, they will consecrate it and complete the days of purification. Then on the eighth day and afterward, the priests will offer your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar, and I will accept you.\" This is the declaration of the Lord God. You know, we're all priests in God's temple, &gt;&gt; meaning we all get to work the altar. We all get to purify the altar and cleanse the altar. And it talks about a bit before this is this 7day purification ritual. And specifically after seven days of purification are complete that from the eighth day onward there will be continuous burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. And then it says that God says that I will accept you. So I think that the the recipe for acceptance from God is actually quite simple. It is to purify yourself. Meaning you have to repent. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't already, you have to get baptized. And then after that like it says continual sacrifices. You have to live daily for God. &gt;&gt; You have to carry your cross daily. And this altar right we know that you know we are in this sense we are both the altar and the sacrifice. We have to purify ourselves and present ourselves as sacrifices before God. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't repented I charge you to repent. &gt;&gt; Oh bro. &gt;&gt; You know if you haven't been baptized then get baptized. &gt;&gt; And if you if you If you've spent time away from your cross, you've dropped it and started to walk without it, go back and pick up your cross. &gt;&gt; It is time to build God's new temple. To God be all the glory. [Music] [Laughter] [Music]",

    "transcript": "[Music] Uh, please turn your Bibles to Luke chapter 13. &gt;&gt; And I I bring you based on interpretation news. &gt;&gt; We're going to take a pause on today's Ezekiel's lesson. &gt;&gt; We're going to hold off for next week. Amen. Uh, and it'll all make sense in a second &gt;&gt; after we read this passage. &gt;&gt; In Luke chapter 13, the Bible reads in verse one, \"At that time, some people came and reported to him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.\" And he responded to them, \"Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful than all the other Galileans because they suffered these things? No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all perish as well. Or those 18 that the tower in Shalom fell on and killed, do you think that they are more sinful than all other people who lived in Jerusalem? No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all perish as well. Jesus always would lay it out straight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I love it. People were reporting to him about these injustices. I'm sure they're asking these questions. Why do they have to die? Well, why are these wicked things happening around us? And his response is simple. You guys have to repent. And it's amazing because Jesus after in this response to these these people whose these god lions whose bloods were mixed with other sacrifices, animal sacrifices, he references his own current events. And he mentions this tower of Saleom which fell down and killed 18 people in which I think today we see tons of whether injustices, innocent people dying and we ask why? Why God? Why are these people dying? And Jesus is God in the flesh's response is it is so you can wake up. &gt;&gt; It is so you can repent. &gt;&gt; And you know it's interesting because they want to have these they're looking for Jesus's spiritual opinion on these social matters on these different issues. And what is his uh opinion quote unquote? What does he have to say that you have to change? I'm glad you're noticing these things, but I'm what I want to point back to you is yourself. &gt;&gt; Are you going to repent? You know, there's so much happening in the world right now. &gt;&gt; There there's a lot of stuff happening on the news, whether it be school shootings, bombings, war, assassinations, innocent people dying in gang violence, in international wars, anything. There's so much darkness happening in the world. And I think it's okay. We in the kingdom don't have to pretend like everything is butterflies and rainbows. We we talk about these things. &gt;&gt; It it is okay to talk about these things. And I think we see here in Jesus example so did he. Jesus was willing to even bring it. People brought it up to him and he brought up his own current situation. Jesus was though he was God in the flesh he was up to date with current events. However, he used current events to tell people they have to be urgent &gt;&gt; and they have to repent. &gt;&gt; You know, our title for us today is be informed, not conformed. &gt;&gt; Be informed, not conformed. And of course, I I'm referencing Romans chapter 12 where it says do not be conformed to this age. Right? So, I I think it's important. It's good for us to know. We must know what is going on in the world around us, but we cannot be consumed by the world around us. We are in the world. Amen. But we are not of the world. We are informed about what's going on, but we are not conformed about what's going on. And if you're indignant about anything, you know, I I see as a father different countries, even people trying to bring it to the United States these policies that allow children to get sex changes behind their parents' backs. &gt;&gt; Like there is absolute wickedness happening in the world right now. You know, there are people like I mentioned, innocent people. I remember my first time being an intern. I was in the city of Philadelphia and on the first day I ever shared my faith, I met this social worker and his job was to go from house to house in a day, a few different houses of recent homicide uh shootings and he would specifically go to houses who had family members who were who died in crossfires. That was his job as a social worker. And and he would tell I remember this the first day I ever uh start interning. And he said, \"I just came from a house whose a mother whose four-year-old son just died in the crossfire of gang violence.\" Like, there is so much wickedness happening in this world. And what did Jesus make of current events? He used them. He talked about them to get people to wake up. You know, I hope you're awake today. &gt;&gt; I I hope you're seeing all this stuff is making you urgent. and and you're awake by what is happening. You know, all of these current events, I believe they can even make or break us as a church. And they could either make us urgent and unified or we can be dull and divided. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Romans chapter 14. &gt;&gt; I have two points for us. Point number one is united we stand or divided we fall. United we stand or divided we fall. Romans chapter 14. We're going to look at how we as a body should view people's different opinions in the church. United we stand or divided we fall. Romans chapter 14 in verse one it says welcome anyone who is weak in faith but don't argue about disputed matters. One person believes he may eat anything while one who is weak eats only vegetables. who eats must not look down on the one who does not eats. And one who does not eat must not judge one who does because God has accepted him. Who are you to judge another household servant? Before his own Lord he stands or falls. He will stand because the Lord is able to make him stand. Jump to verse 13. Says, \"Therefore, let us no longer judge one another. and said, \"Decide never to put up a stumbling block or pitfall in the way of your brother or sister.\" I know and I am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. Still, to someone who is uh considers a thing to be unclean, to that one it is unclean. For if your brother or sister is hurt by what you eat, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy by what you eat someone for whom Christ died. Therefore, do not let your good be slandered. For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Whoever serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and receives human approval. You know, the church will and always will make up of people of different opinions. &gt;&gt; Uh uh and the Bible will call it disput disputable matters. And the the it's talking about even before it talks about food, it it states do not argue over disputable matters. And then it goes into an example of a disputable matter which was talked about in the church at that time. actually uh when Natt and I were in India for a year this was in in US in the US it's not a common topic but this actually is a topic in a nation where Hinduism is very prevalent and I have actually had to help brothers who would argue over eating food sacrificed to idols because what would happen is you know people would give big donations to a Hindu temple they would do some sort of ceremony with it and then they would go out in the streets and literally give it out for free And so of course there's you know disciples we we you know we love free food you know and I love free food and it was the debate of you know like bro like you shouldn't eat that right now and we had to actually go back the grassroots the Bible this issue of eating unclean foods and so even though it doesn't happen here it's interesting to think that happens in other parts around the world. Amen. But it's not even it's talking about food as an example but overall it's talking about not arguing over disputable matters. The word disputable in the Greek, it literally means thoughts. That's literally what it means. Like do not argue over your personal thoughts. And uh the point of this passage of course in verse three is not to judge one another or look down on someone because their faith is in a different spot than you. &gt;&gt; Because their thought system is in a different spot than you. But instead, it says to accept one another even if you don't understand why they're doing what they're doing. You know, in verse 15, I really love it. Uh it literally says, \"For if your brother or sister is hurt by what you eat, you are no longer walking according to love.\" You know, if we do say, or consume something that causes another brother or sister to stumble, says we are no longer walking according to love. You know, it's so easy to think, well, it's on that's on them. That's their conscience issue. That is their faith issue. And it does literally say in the beginning that it is because of their weak conscience. So, the Bible acknowledges their weak conscience, but then says if you then don't acknowledge it and walk according to it out of love, then you're hurting them. You're putting a stumbling block before them. I think it's actually a powerful passage to think about because there is so much biblical evidence in the New Testament that it is okay to eat whatever food you want. And so literally of a matter that can be proven by scripture, the Bible says don't even worry about us. Just make sure you're not bringing up a stumbling block. &gt;&gt; You know, there's um there's this quote. It says, \"Those who never retract their opinions love themselves more than they love truth.\" &gt;&gt; And I'll be I I had to really wrestle with this this week actually. And uh on uh uh this a brother uh came to me and brought to light uh an issue that I wasn't aware of in the moment. Hey bro, I was talking to a brother and it seems that maybe you didn't get maybe you didn't intend it, but it seems like you were slandering somebody. I was like, \"Really?\" And so we spent the next hour talking about it and I was like, \"Oh, wow. I wasn't that wasn't my I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that.\" So he told me these other brothers who were involved I should apologize to. And I had the decision. Could I try to stand my ground and say, \"Well, I I had good intent that it wasn't my intention. I I did my best to lift this brother up while speaking the truth.\" Or do I say, \"You know what? I what I did was against the Bible. It was not loving.\" And so I had to choose to take my own opinions about what I thought that I did and accept the fact that you know what, I likely did hurt somebody. That is enough evidence for me to apologize. &gt;&gt; So I had to apologize to two different men because I I realize if I'm in the wrong, I'm in the wrong. It's not it's not about what I think. It's about what God thinks. Amen. You know, another occasion, a brother came up to me uh about uh something that I was preaching and he there was something that I said in my preaching that he that he learned something from that I didn't even mean to say, but he dug into it, did a Bible study on it, came back to me, said, \"Hey, bro, I I I think based off of what you said, it doesn't quite match this further Bible study that I did.\" And we talked for the next 45 minutes on it. And then after a while, I'm like, I'm pretty convinced, like, oh my goodness. Yeah, I I think I actually preached an error and not even realized this. And so I actually asked this brother to write up a Bible study and do a lesson on it. So I think it could be really cool. Um and I think it'd be really cool because I was convicted by what he was showing me actually. Um but but these are examples that this week alone, the past few days, I've had to wrestle with putting my opinions and putting them to the side for the sake of love and the truth of the gospel. &gt;&gt; And so I don't want to call you guys to do anything that I'm unwilling to do. Amen. And I want you guys to ask yourself, what matters more to you, being right or the truth? &gt;&gt; Being right or the truth. We go to 1 Corinthians chapter 8. 1 Corinthians chapter 8 in verse one. It's a very similar parallel passage, same author by Paul. In verse one, it says, \"Now about food sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. If anyone thinks he knows anything, he does not yet know it as he ought to know it.\" &gt;&gt; But if anyone loves God, he is known by him. You know, we have to be very careful, especially with right now I'm talking about current events, political matters. We have to be very careful not to think that objective truth caters to you. Very careful. Why? Because it says knowledge puffs up but love builds up. Even in the case that you want to present to somebody why in this example it's okay to eat food sacrifice to idols. What's more important than giving him this you know 10 scripture Bible study is showing him love. Showing him or her love. And I think that There will be events like this in the future ahead of us. Many events, political events, whether it be senseless killing. You know, I I think we we're all hearing about the wars happening in the Middle East, about the bombs going off. We're hearing about, you know, school shootings happening all around the world right now. There's genocides and assassinations. There's just brutal murders happening. And these will continue to happen. Like this is not any unfamiliar events, right? But I think that we have to know that we can't just buck up under our perspective and our knowledge because what is more important than your understanding, more important than your knowledge is love. &gt;&gt; Choosing to love. And literally the past scripture literally says that even if what you're saying is objectively truthful in the Bible, it is okay to eat whatever clean food, it is okay to, you know, believe in this perspective on social issues. that what is even better is showing love to those who don't understand it, &gt;&gt; you know. Um, uh, I think it's super important because this could really bring if we take it wholeheartedly in the way God wants us to, we can really see a really strong fear of God because of these events. We can be more unified than ever because of these events. You know, in reality, these different events probably happen every few years, just to be really honest. You know, every election cycle these kinds of things happen, right? Every time some new disease happens, whether it's Ebola, the Spanish flu, or COVID, like every few years, these events always happen, but we can be informed by them and use it to be more unified than ever. You know, I I think that uh even what's happened recently, um it's really just a sampler. It's really I I think it's really just a sampler. Why Why do I really say that? I want us to kind of go back the the the Bible in in the Gospels talks about the end times, right? And specifically Jesus says in Matthew that the all that um this will happen in the lifetime of the apostles. And so there's actually two different events. There is the end times and the day and hour unknown. Two different events. And specifically the end times correlates to the temple being destroyed in 70 AD. The last book of the Bible, Revelation, is speculated to be written around 90 AD. That means between Jesus's ministry and 90 AD, there is a massive genocide of the Jewish people and a little bit of the Christians that isn't even talked about in the Bible. It's barely referenced, but you get a little bit of speculation because the amount of times the Bible says be sober minded. the mountain times the Bible says be on your guard to be alert and it's not specifically talking about the destruction of the temple but it's using these different events to get the Christians to get the disciples to wake up to be urgent to be fervent in prayer to to be about sharing your faith to teaching one another like these things we can actually learn from them and to be closer to God by them &gt;&gt; and be closer to each other because of them &gt;&gt; and you know we have to make a decision uh that uh to know that our battle is not against flesh and blood. That's the reality. The battle is not against flesh and blood. That we are we have to be united in a spiritual battle. In verse seven of chapter 8, it says uh however not everyone has this knowledge right about food sacrifice to idols is okay to eat. Some have been so used to idolatry up until now that when they eat food sacrificed to an idol, their conscience being weak is defiles. Food will not bring us close to God. We are not worse off if we don't eat, and we are not better if we do eat. But be careful that this ride of yours in no way becomes a stumbling block to the weak. For if someone sees you, the one who has knowledge, dining in an idol's temple, imagine that in a disciple in an idol's temple because of free food. The Bible says it's okay. Amen. It says, it says, \"Won't his weak conscience be encouraged to eat food offered to idols?\" So the weak person, the brother or sister for whom Christ died is ruins by your knowledge. Now when you sin like this against brothers and sisters and wound their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ. Therefore, if food causes my brother or sister to fall, I will never again eat meats so that I won't cause my brother or sister to fall. Lots of similarities to the previous passage, but once again, I'm trying to hone in that it's not just talking about food. The the topic of all this is not just about food and it's literally like you can prove it through the Bible that it is okay to eat these things like it is like he literally says it is if you have knowledge the knowledge of the scriptures you are okay in as long as your conscience isn't violated to literally enter a temple and eat their food and leave and you are totally okay. But if someone doesn't have that same knowledge, that same understanding that you shouldn't do it to cause the stumbling block for them. And I kind of rule by in the sense of if if I know it'll cause this person to struggle, I won't even bring it up in front of them. &gt;&gt; Whatever topic I believe, we all have different political beliefs, but if I know it might cause someone to stumble, I won't bring it up. Paul takes it further. He says, \"I will never do it again. It's not dependent on who's around him. He will literally never do it again. Isn't that crazy? You know, I was I was thinking about this. Um who who here um has people that they live with in their home? Okay, keep your hand up. Who here, you know, is the person that sometimes leaves articles of clothing around the house? &gt;&gt; Okay. Mostly men. Okay. Who here, if you do that, has people living the house constantly telling you to put it in the laundry bin? Okay. A lot of people here. Okay. Okay. So, this is what I mean by this, right? So, so you know, I I love my wife. She She does a great job at wanting the house to always be presentable, but you know, I I I'll come home, I'm like, I just want to sit on the couch, &gt;&gt; take the socks off, take the jacket off, and I let me just sit for just five seconds. And and the the reality is she, hey, babe, you know, it's just a a few second walk, just put it in the bin. Totally understandable, right? Um but but um but and so I could really present to her, babe, I promise you that by the end of tonight, all these clothes will be in the laundry bed and I could try to present a 10point PowerPoint, give evidence on the seven out of 10 times I've ever done that before and say, \"I will definitely do it, but it would encourage her if I put it away right away.\" &gt;&gt; And so So regardless of whatever proof or what how I might try to convince her that it's okay for to lay there just for a few hours and I might forget till the next day but I'll definitely pick it up in the morning that it'll be better just to encourage her &gt;&gt; to to let go of what I think and what will encourage her. You know it's the same thing right here. You know, I want you guys to ask yourself, are you willing to drop any opinion for the sake of your brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; And of course, like I'm saying, I I believe, okay, if if it causes a person to stumble, I wouldn't do it in front of them. But I'm trying to go further for the sake of unity, for the sake of the kingdom, the body of Christ. Are you willing to forgo it all together? Like that is how unified we should be &gt;&gt; and that is the example we see here in the scriptures. You know I I really want us to all hold the the same conviction about any issue. Why? Because what matters above knowledge is love. &gt;&gt; What matters above truth is unity. &gt;&gt; That is the example that we see in the Bible. Let's go to first Peter chapter 1. First Peter chapter one, point number two. Right? So we're talking about unity and being together as a family no matter what, dropping any opinion. But point number two, what we can learn from being informed by current events is also urgency. First Peter chapter 1 verse 13, the Bible reads, \"Therefore, with your minds ready for action, be sober minded and set your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.\" As obedient children, do not be conformed to the desires of your former ignorance. But as the one who called you as holy, you are all you are also to be holy in all your conducts. You know the things that stand out to me in this passage. It literally says have your minds ready for action says to be sober minded. Set your hope completely on the grace. It's so easy to set our hope maybe in other people, maybe in certain policies, but what we set our hope in completely is the coming of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I want you guys to ask, are you ready for action? &gt;&gt; And then I'll further that question. What kind of action are you ready for? because we're in a spiritual battle. Amen. And to be ready for action, spiritual action, it means you have to know the enemy that we're fighting and to know his schemes. &gt;&gt; How does he take over this dark world? You know, you can't be ready for action if there's habitual sin in your life. &gt;&gt; It is a paradox. If you're looking at the world and you're informed by the utter darkness in the world and you realize that as a disciple that it is literally within you the key to eternal life for these people who have no idea why these things are happening and yet still live in sin. It is a paradox &gt;&gt; to be urgent and then to live in habitual sin. And so let's make the decision to be urgent to look at the world for what it really is. You know, we are talking about being bold for other people's sake. We're talking about saving the lives of billions. And what it takes is putting in time, energy, sweats, possible failure, the the temptation to be discouraged or even being discouraged at times, but putting it all on the line to share with anyone who's just willing just to even have a conversation. &gt;&gt; You put it all on the line. And sometimes it takes even to the thousandth person that you share with for them to finally say, \"All right, I'll open up the Bible.\" Because we're not talking just about success, quote unquote, and people actually being willing, but we're talking about seeing the world for what it is and being relentless in our faithful pursuit of winning this world regardless of how many people come to church. What we're talking about is at least letting them know that there is a refuge, that there is a sanctuary. And how could there be a sanctuary if we're not unified in the body? How could there be a sanctuary if we're not urgent to bring people to us? You know, I think um we have to really see the state of the world and let it make us urgent drive us to a point of indignation. You know, I love verse 14 in here. It says once again, do not be conformed to the desires of your former ignorance. It reminded me of the past passage when it said that there are those who have weak consciences because of their previous idolatry. And I I think that we could take you could take uh three different approaches in this one. I know me before I became a disciple, I was a person that ignored all of things happening in the world. I ignored the news. I ignored social and political events. And to me, I would drown myself in entertainments, uh, drown myself in sin. And if someone tried to bring up to me a conversation, you know, whatever small talk about politics, I would like, let's please change the subject. I really don't care about this right now. And that is one approach that's might happen. Another approach is maybe you're trying to be informed and in that you get super involved. Maybe your past life you were super involved, an extreme social activist, right? You're going to rallies, you're at the front lines with a megaphone, you know, you have the stickers on your backpack and every all around you and you know, you're saying all these different chants, but instead of you're focusing people on all of the bad laws around you, instead of focusing people on God's law, and the reality is I don't think we should necessarily be either person. We shouldn't be so uninvolved and we should neither be extremely too involved. And Instead, we have to be informed so that we can be indignant about the dark world around us. And like Jesus, he knew what was going on, but he used it to wake people up to repentance and to come into a relationship with him. You know, if if it's you, right, and you're seeing uh the darkness in the world, what does it mean to make a choice to be urgent? Because urgency is not a feeling. It is a choice. How do you make the choice to be urgent is you look at the world around you and you become indignant godly sorrow and then you say I'm going to do something about it. That is and and if you try you could try to want to do something about it but if you're not informed do something about what what are you trying to do? What are you trying to stop people from doing it? It is important but not to be consumed by it, not to be conformed by it, not to be anxious by it, but to be awake from it, to be informed by it, and then to help others repent because of this. &gt;&gt; And I think it's important to always know no matter what is happening, though we're being informed, people might have different opinions in the church, that is okay. It is okay for different opinions in the church, but we all agree that it is what it is Christ that people need in their lives. Christ is the answer for everybody. &gt;&gt; Let's close out in John chapter 17. &gt;&gt; John chapter 17. This is Jesus. He He's praying in the garden. He says in verse 20, I pray not only for these, but also for those who believe in me through their word. May they all be one as you, Father, are in me and I am in you. They may they also be in us so that the world may believe you sent me. I have given them the glory you have given me so that they may be one as we are one. I am in them and you are in me so that they may be made completely one. that the whole world may know uh you have sent me and have loved them as you have loved me. Father, I want those you have given me uh to be with me where I am so that they will see my glory which you have given me because you loved me before the world's foundation. Righteous Father, the world has not known you. However, I have known you and they have known that you sent me. I made your name known to them and will continue to make it known so that the love you have loved me with may be in them and I may be in them. You know, one of Jesus's final prayers was praying that all of the believers would be one. And I don't know what lies ahead, but I'm sure there will be more turmoil. There will be more conflicts. There will be more reasons that Satan will try to get us to be divided. Yet Jesus prays that we could all be one. And why are all of these issues really happening? Verse 25 it says is because the world does not know God. That is why all these issues are happening. The world does not know God. But Jesus makes him known among us. And it says in verse 26, he will continue to make him known among us. Why is this crazy? Because he is about to go to the cross. He's about to be crucified and then resurrected and preached and then leave. What does he mean by the world continuing to know God through us, it is though he died, his power still resides in us. That that we have the light residing in us to change this dark world. And I think it's important for us now to always know that if you don't think you have the power, if you're struggling in believing you have the power, now is the time to be urgent. Now the time to be unified. Look at what's happening around you and make the decision. It's not a rush of a feeling. Urgency is the decision. Say, you know what? Jesus gave me his word. I have this kingdom. I can do something about it. See, we do what we do because of love. We do what we do for love. And we do what we do with love. And to God be all the glory.

        "insight": "The speaker explains that Jesus responded to current tragic events (like the Galileans' massacre and the tower of Siloam's fall) not to explain *why* they happened, but to provoke repentance. He uses these incidents as a call for everyone to examine their own lives and urgently turn to God, emphasizing that these events should wake people up rather than simply prompt questions about injustice."

        "verse": "Romans 12:2",
        "insight": "This verse underpins the sermon's title, 'Be Informed, Not Conformed.' It teaches that while believers should be aware of the world's happenings—including its darkness and injustices—they must not allow the world's values or anxieties to shape their identity or spiritual walk. Christians are encouraged to know what's going on but not be consumed by it, maintaining their distinct identity in Christ."

        "verse": "Romans 14:1-4",
        "insight": "This passage introduces the concept of 'disputable matters' within the church, such as dietary practices. The sermon emphasizes that believers should welcome those with weaker faith and avoid judging or arguing over personal opinions, especially if doing so causes a brother or sister to stumble. The core message is that love and unity should supersede individual knowledge or convictions, even if one's stance is biblically permissible."

The speaker highlights that causing a brother or sister to stumble by exercising one's 'knowledge' is a sin against Christ, urging a willingness to forgo personal rights for the sake of another's conscience and the unity of the church."

    "book_reference": "Ezekiel 34-37",
    "series_number": 25,
    "transcript": "[Music] We're doing a expository analysis of the book of Ezekiel. Sometimes we'll go from point to point, chapter to chapter, and it may not tie in together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh the title for us today is God sanctifies his people. And we're going to bring that point all together at the very end. But we're going to start off here in Ezekiel 34. Have you guys been enjoying the series so far? &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. It's my first time doing it. &gt;&gt; In Ezekiel chapter 34, it says in verse one, the word of the Lord came to me. Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to them, this is what the Lord God says to the shepherds. Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves. Shouldn't the shepherds feed their flock? You eat the fat, wear the wool, and butcher the fatted animals, but you do not tend the flock. You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bandaged the injured, brought back the strays, or sought the lost. Instead, you have ruled them with violence and cruelty. They were scattered for lack of a shepherd. They became food for all the wild animals. When they were scattered, my flock went astray on all the mountains and every high hill. My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and there was no one searching or seeking for them. So, here we are. We've read so much of God pronouncing judgment against Israel and Judah, judgment against the surrounding nations. We've seen the sins that they've committed, rebellion, we've seen idolatry. We've even dabbled in the the most heinous and I believe they've done which is child sacrifice. But here God takes a bit of a step back. He he says what really started it all and it was that the leaders were not leading. And you know these shepherds you know who were they? They were the the the priests, the king of Israel and Judah, the Levites. It would have been the the princes of the the sons of the kings, the army commanders, the city officials, anyone with influence, but they were supposed to guide. They're supposed to protect and nourish God's people, but it said they were too busy feeding themselves. &gt;&gt; It's actually a bit of a play on words. The the word shepherd uh is raw in in Hebrew and it literally means to feed. So they should have been feeding God's people, helping them be nourished, giving them the word, but instead they were feeding themselves. They are meant to be a staff, a shepherd staff, a guide to all of Israel, but there they were amongst the rest of the flock eating and grazing on the gas on the grass. And I think it's so important to understand this. When a shepherd is too busy feeding themselves, it leaves God's people without a leader. Point number one is the strength to give. You know, being a leader, being someone that is responsible for other people, I believe that is not a talent. I believe being a leader is not something that you're born with, but it is something that you are created into. &gt;&gt; Think of it this way, right? Let's say, you know, you're going into a dating relationship. Uh you're you're getting married for the first time. It's not like some magical storage box in your brain suddenly unlocks and now you have the the the master capabilities of all sources of communication. You you have you now that you're in a relationship, all of a sudden you became a a master at patience, &gt;&gt; a a master at, you know, being understanding and accepting one another's flaws and that it was just some hidden skill waiting to unlock once you got into a relationship. You were born with it. God was just waiting to open the door once you're in that relationship. Wrong. You know, like it it takes time. It takes experience. It it takes, you know, you're training yourself. If you're being disciplined, you know, you're being molded into a leader, &gt;&gt; molded into somebody that learns how to be responsible for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Let's say the same thing. If you have kids, it's not like when you have your firstborn, all of a sudden, God was just waiting to unlock this safe of all the knowledge of what to do and what not to do. and the moment your child was born. If you've ever seen Doctor Strange all of a sudden like you you just relive this experience and it's like mesmerizing. But no, you you learn to be a mother, a father through experience, sadly sometimes through trial. &gt;&gt; Um and but you get better at it with time. Amen. &gt;&gt; And being a leader is not something you're just born with. You you you're made into it. &gt;&gt; And I was looking at these two different things. parenthood uh in marriage and I was looking at the top reasons why maybe someone wouldn't want to do these things. What are the top reasons why someone may not want to get married? Uh the top three reasons that I found uh why people don't want to get married uh in increasing order. Number three is fear of divorce. Many people don't want to get married because sadly the the uh examples they have seen of those in their family and those around them of what divorce does to a person. Number two uh is they want to seek personal growth or self-discovery which is interesting is because they want to grow while at the same time not learning responsibility which is quite interesting and there's no greater responsibility than God giving you another life to take care of. &gt;&gt; But the number one reason why people don't want to get married is because of independence and autonomy. ve &gt;&gt; very simply speaking it's they would rather live a life without having to focus on somebody else &gt;&gt; only themselves so I was looking at similarly what are the reasons why people don't want kids and I was looking at for those who say they don't want kids what are the top reasons uh number three in increasing order is they have concerns about the state of the world which I think is fairly understandable cuz when you look at the world around you like yeah it's it's kind of going in flames sometimes you know or all the time. Uh number two I think the first two the last the first two are interesting but number two is wanting to focus on other things. It's I don't want kids because I don't want to focus on kids if I were to have them. It's to me it's a a very selfish way of thinking because when you learn to be selfless, when you learn to care for this young innocent child who does nothing but, you know, throw up every now and then, give you poopy diapers, and doesn't ask you how you're doing that day, if everything's okay, you know, you you you really learn some things. Amen. Um the the number one reason I think is actually not a reason at all is they just don't want to which if I ask you you know why don't you want to have kids you say I don't want to have kids okay but why is I don't want to have kids but why I don't want to have that's not a reason so I think the actual number one reason is the number two reason which is they want to focus on other things and so what do we learn why do people not want to get married why do people not want to have kids is because they simply don't want the responsibility They just want to focus on themselves. And I believe that this lack of desire for being responsible for others can easily make its way into the church. &gt;&gt; Let's go to First Peter chapter 5. &gt;&gt; First Peter chapter 5. Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; It says in verse one of First Peter 5, I exhort the elders among you as a fellow elder and witness to the sufferings of Christ. So this is Peter speaking to other elders as another elder himself. Amen. says, \"As well as the one who shares in the glory about to be revealed, shepherd God's flock among you, not overseeing out of compulsion, but willingly as God would have you. Not out of greed for money, but eagerly, not luring it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.\" And when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. You know, this passage is powerful. And of course, this is very specifically addressed to the elders. And what we would call elders is in this church would be shepherds. Amen. Uh so this would be addressed to maybe the the the shepherds in this church, those who you know are responsible for helping tend to the flock, right? And their role is by their godly knowledge and godly experience is to lead others by example. But here's the issue. It is so easy to read a passage like this, wipe the sweat off your brow, and say, \"Thank goodness it's not talking about me, man. If I had to be an example to other people, I don't know, that sounds like a little much.\" And what happens is we say, you know, I I I read this passage. It was going somewhere, but I'm so glad I I barely made it out of it alive. It doesn't apply to me. Oh, thank goodness. I I'm glad that is someone else's responsibility. And uh I want to share about a young man in this church. His name is Rob Rablooki. &gt;&gt; And on on two different occasions uh he has asked me what it takes to lead the singles ministry. &gt;&gt; And it's interesting if you know who disciples him. &gt;&gt; The man who leads the singles ministry currently. And he's like, \"Mully, what does it take to take my discipller's job?\" You know, I'm just interested in that. Um but but he's he's asked me you know what does it take you know at another time he's also asked me hey there there's there's men and women studying the Bible at HCC you know can can we start a ministry and a focus there as well unprompted he comes to me with this desire to lead &gt;&gt; this desire to do more and he comes pretty much every single time to leaders meeting Bible talk leaders meeting even though he doesn't even lead a Bible talk &gt;&gt; he just wants to lead And we see the example of the opposite in Ezekiel. While there are shepherds in Ezekiel who were too busy to feed themselves that it was the cause of Israel's downfall, today you can choose not to focus on feeding yourself but helping feed those around you. I believe that right now if we as a church, as a body, as a people collectively start to cast responsibility on other people, thinking it's someone else's job, I don't have to be an example. I don't have to be responsible. We will see the downfall of this church. &gt;&gt; We all have to desire to lead. You know, I believe in this very powerfully. I think every disciple, every single one of us should desire to be a shepherd one day. &gt;&gt; Here's why I believe that. Because one, you're saying that I'm going to live a long time as a disciple. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to die. I'm going to die as a disciple. So when I'm like Anthony, 35 years in the faith, 50 years in the faith, whatever it is, I want to give the experience that God has allowed me to have to other people. &gt;&gt; But if you're telling yourself you don't want to be the shepherd, I wonder if you really desire longevity in your walk with God. Cuz at the very end of your walk with God, with all the life lessons, the victories, the defeats, the lessons that you've learned, what do you plan on doing with it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I think every disciple should desire to be a shepherd. &gt;&gt; You know, what will you do with the experience that God has given you? &gt;&gt; And are you starting now to desire to lead? You know, we can't get to where we want to go unless we desire to feed others more than we want to feed ourselves. You know, in Philippians chapter 2, you know, going away from this passage that specifically is addressed to elders, it literally says everyone should look not to his own interests, but rather to the interests of others. It says in Acts 20:35 that it is more blessed to give than to receive. See, this is a principle common to everybody. Everyone should desire to give rather than to be fed. Everyone should desire to put others interests above their own. You know, I want to challenge every single one of us here. Desire to lead. &gt;&gt; Desire to lead. Desire to lead Bible studies &gt;&gt; to to be in Bible studies. Meet someone that you don't know or a friend that you've known for years since your childhood and lead them to God. &gt;&gt; You know, desire to disciple at least one person. &gt;&gt; Find someone that you can mentor on a regular basis. you know, desire to lead Bible discussions and lead a Bible talk one day. You know, learn to be uh responsible over more people. Amen. You know, for those who aren't in any relationships, desire to be a husband or a wife, &gt;&gt; desire to be a mother or a father. Like, you should desire to do those things. Amen. Um, you know, I probably talked to Travis and Kiara and the Beretttos. I talked to Alex, you know, hey, you know, when do you want to be, you know, parents? I'm just curious. You know when when do you guys want to do that? Cuz it should be a desire at least at some point in history to have children. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I think every disciple should desire to be an example and to help others. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Ezekiel 34. &gt;&gt; Awesome. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter 34, uh, same chapter. In verse 10, it says, \"This is what the Lord God says. Look, I am against the shepherds. I will demand my flock from them and prevent them from shephering the flock. The shepherds will no longer feed themselves, for I will rescue my flock from their mouths so that they will not be food for them.\" Okay, so we just learned that the shepherds were feeding themselves and not feeding the flock. But we learned that one of the things that they were feeding on was the people themselves. &gt;&gt; Yeah. that God had to rescue the rest of his people from the mouths of the shepherds. Let's keep going. In verse 16, it says, \"I will seek the lost.\" This is God speaking. \"Bring back the strays, bandage the injured, and strengthen the weak, but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will shepherd them with justice. As for you, my flock, the Lord God says this, \"Look, I am going to judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the goats. Isn't it enough for you to feed on good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of the pasture with your feet? Or isn't it enough that you drink the clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? Yet my flock has to feed on what your feet have trampled. And drink the water that your feet have muddied. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says to them. See, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. Since you have pushed with flank and shoulder, and budded all the weak ones with your horns, until you scatter them all over, I will save my flock, and they will no longer be prey. And I will judge between one sheep and another. I will establish over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will shepherd them. He will tend themself and will be their shepherd. I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I the Lord have spoken. You see, it's those who would grow fat, would go strong while trampling on the the pasture and mudding the waters of the rest of the sheep while they grow lean. It is those that God destroys who who don't let others grow around them. So, what do we learn about these bad shepherds? They feed themselves and not others. uh that they one of the things they feed on is not just pasture but other sheep, other children of God. And when they feed on the other pasture, they ruin it for everybody else. And they push and shoulder and lord it over the weak ones around them. I believe that this is talking about ferocitical leadership. &gt;&gt; Very specifically, the the spirit of pheriseical leadership because this is long before Jesus ever came. This is literally o over 500 years before Jesus ever came. And we see this spirit of pheriseical leadership even during this time. And of course in verse 23 you see these prophecies scattered throughout the Bible relating Jesus to David. You know we we we sing the song Lion of Judah because David is from the line the line of Judah and Jesus is from the line of Judah as you see in Matthew as well. And I I love the scripture that we read in the kingdom study where in Isaiah chapter 2 it says, \"Come let us go to the mountains of the Lord to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us about his ways so that we may walk in his paths.\" It is literally saying that Jesus will come down to us and teach us personally. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How to walk in the way of life. And I think that is so powerful that he is trying to redeem us from ferocitical leadership. Those who lead us but maybe don't want to lead. and those, you know, being in a in a body, being in a church where no one wants to lead at all. But let's go to Ezekiel 35. Let's keep moving. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 35. Uh this will be a prophecy against Edom. And Edom is interesting because we read uh two Sundays ago how God announced judgment against seven different nations, all lined in a row in chapters. But here, Edom is soloed out. And we'll look at why in a second. In Ezekiel 35 and:10 it says, \"Because you said these two nations and two lands will be mine and we will possess them. Though the Lord was there, therefore as I live, this is the declaration of the Lord God. I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them. I will make myself known among them when I judge you. Then you will know that I the Lord have heard all the blasphemies you uttered against the mountains of Israel saying they are desolate and they have been given to us to devour. You know this passage is interesting and the question is why would Ezekiel why would God tell Ezekiel to solo out Edom compared to the rest of the nations? Well, when Israel uh left the slavery of Egypt, they crossed the the Red Sea, the very first nation to persecute them was the And what happened was, you know, Moses went to their borders. He said, \"Hey, can we pass through? We won't let our sheep graze on your grass. We won't drink water from your well. We will go straight through without stopping.\" And the king uh of the said, \"No, you can't come through.\" But Moses pleaded. He's like, \"Why? we're not going to take anything from you. So the king of Edom literally came with a vast army blocking the border. So they would have to go all the way around. So the reason why they're sold out here is because Edom was the very first nation to persecute them. And so here we are years later. God is saying, \"All right, I'm returning the hatred you had on my people back to you.\" You know what they say that if you can't, you know, take it, don't serve it. &gt;&gt; You know, God's like, \"Okay, well, you treated my people this way. I'm only returning it back to you.\" Is that not fair? &gt;&gt; Is that not okay? Cuz you treated them this way for almost a thousand years. It'll be okay if I do it for a few. Right? You know, I think it's interesting, and this is how we should view persecution, not to uh take into account the words that people say, but the lives that God now judges them by. &gt;&gt; You know, uh a close friend of mine who uh started persecuting the church. You know, he uh had we're still close. We still talk to this day. Um and I I love him to death. Um but you know he he left the church with lots of uh hatred and bitterness and express you know hatred toward another specific brother and we can talk about we never go into doctrine or the specific reasons why but I remember one day he told me that he he felt hatred to the point of thoughts of murder and it doesn't really matter what you have against us or whatever it is but that is your own personal vendetta between you and God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you are the sole reason why that is in your heart. And the sad thing is that though that is in his heart, what is portrayed through social media is his great life. I think it's so hard to look past the words and look at the lives that God gives those who persecute us because of social media. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to look at social media and say, \"Everyone's living great lives.\" You know, well, I understand. Like look at them. They they judge me. They persecute me, but it looks like they're they're doing fine themselves. Well, you never know what's going on on the inside. &gt;&gt; And I hope that, you know, as we don't take words into account, that we look at the lives that people give us not to be fooled by social media and what people post on their Instagram stories. Let's go to Ezekiel 36. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 36 and verse one. It says, \"Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord God says because the enemy has said about you. Aha, the enemy uh the ancient heights have become our possession. Therefore, prophesy and say this what the Lord God says because they have made you desolate and have trampled you from every side so that you become a possession for the rest of the nations and an object of the people's gossip and slander. Therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God. This is what the Lord God says to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys, to the desolate ruins and abandoned cities, which have become plunder and a mockery to the rest of the nations all around. This is what the Lord God says. Certainly, in my burning zeal, I will speak against the rest of the nations and all of Edom, who took my land as their own possession with the with wholehearted rejoicing and utter contempt, so that this so that its pasture land became plunder. Therefore, prophesy concerning Israel's land, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys. This is what the Lord God says. Look, I speak in my burning zeal, because you have endured the insults of the nations. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says. I will swear that the nations all around you will endure their own insults. You mountains of Israel will produce your branches and bear your fruit for my people Israel since their arrival is near. Look, I am on your side. I will turn toward you and you will be tilled and swn. I will fill you with people, with the whole house of Israel in its entirety. The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. I will fill you with people and animals, and they will increase and be fruitful. I will make you inhabited as you once were and make you better off than you were before. Then you will know that I am the Lord. I will cause people, my people, Israel, to walk on you. They will possess you and will be and you will be their inheritance. You will no longer deprive them of their children. When I first read this passage, I'll be honest, I was super confused. Why does God tell Ezekiel to speak to an inanimate object? Doesn't that like rouse questions in your minds? &gt;&gt; Like, is they going to respond back to him? Are the mountains all of a sudden going to speak? Like, what are they are the mountains going to repent? Like, I'm confused. Like, why would God tell Ezekiel to speak to mountains, but it's not against them, but for them? It's a little confusing, right? Well, I I have an image. I think it's important to know what a mountain is. Mountains are huge. They're they're, you know, they're massive. But I realized that, you know, there there's not many mountains here in Florida. &gt;&gt; I I was looking up the the the the tallest point in all of Florida, and I found a picture of it. Travis, uh, can you &gt;&gt; That is the tallest point &gt;&gt; in all of Florida. &gt;&gt; Isn't that crazy? &gt;&gt; Who here has actually seen a mountain before? Like a real mountain? &gt;&gt; Okay, this is good. Amen. Amen. Isn't that crazy that you if you to see a mountain, you have to travel outside of the state? That is it's called Sugarloaf Hill and the tallest point in all Florida. Isn't that crazy? &gt;&gt; I just thought that'd be interesting just to look at. Um that's that's just a picture I wanted. We haven't done a picture in a while, so I figured this would be the picture &gt;&gt; uh the picture that we can look at. Um &gt;&gt; where's the [Applause] [Music] ball? [Applause] Wow. Look at it. &gt;&gt; I see it now. Wow. Thank you, Travis. Uh, our our our world sector cyber ministry evangelist. &gt;&gt; Um, yeah, this is pretty awesome. But, you know, we're we're talking about mountains, though, not these small little hills. I I mean massive tall mountains, right? And God is telling Ezekiel to prophesy for them, right? But, you know, let's look at not just what mountains are, but what are mountains in relation to Israel? uh the both the good and the bad, right? So what are ways that God has used mountains? So God spoke to Moses um through a burning bush on a mountain. &gt;&gt; God gave the ten commandments to Moses on a mountain. Uh God uh had his temple be built on Jerusalem, the highest point, but specifically the temple was on the tallest part of all of Israel. Right? God always used mountains for his glory. However, at the very end that we read in verse 12, it says, \"You will no longer,\" speaking to the mountains, \"you will no longer deprive them of their children.\" What were mountains used for when Israel then inhabited them? When they came into these nations, 2 Kings 17:10, write this down. In Ezekiel 6:3, it says that they sacrificed under every on every high hill and under every green tree. What were these sacrifices? They would literally burn their children to this idol called Molech that they they would have, you know, astropoles there. They would make their children walk on fire for whatever harvest or abundance. And that literally what God intended to use for his glory, they used for sin and idolatry. &gt;&gt; Wow. And it literally says that the mountains have become plunder and a mockery to the surrounding nations. Not because of God, but because the people sinned on these mountains. And God, you know, looks at what he wanted his people to use for his glory. But instead, they use it for their own sin. And other people mock them for their shameful acts. But in verse 11, God will once again bring his people back that they will inhabit these mountains and that it says that that they will increase and they will be fruitful. And the question is what are these mountains today? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, I think that these mountains are foundations that God has intended for good. But man, specifically us, God's people, can twist because of our sin. And therefore, other people look at shamefully. Here's an example. Disciplehip and accountability. The Bible says teach them to obey. The Bible says, uh, if your brother sins, take it to them. The Bible also says, share all good things with your instructor. that there are very clear examples that God has commanded us to have accountability over one another. Yet sometimes because of sin, because of maybe fear of the person discipling or mentoring or selfish ambition, it people can be hurt. &gt;&gt; It can be lorded over people and it makes other people think discipling is ridiculous. It makes persecutors say that we're controlling, but not because in and in and of itself is bad, but we make it bad because of our sin. &gt;&gt; I think another thing is coming to church, &gt;&gt; coming to Bible talk, coming to midweek, going to DVOS, having family time, spending extra time in your day to devote yourself to other Christians. Right? The Bible says, \"Don't give up meeting together.\" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It says to encourage one another daily. It said the disciples devoted themselves to the fellowship. to the seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and can and have others lorded it over you before. Maybe maybe it's happened but that doesn't make it bad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I think it's important especially with meeting together that the Bible says that faith comes from hearing the word. I think sometimes we try to supplement someone teaching us the word of God with our own personal quiet times which are important but it doesn't replace the power of hearing the word and having someone guide you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. having someone teach you and sometimes I believe mountains like these that we sometimes bring sin into we can face ridicule of and people you know no not people but our own personal response is to remove these mountains maybe if we didn't have disciplehip we wouldn't have these issues &gt;&gt; maybe if we didn't have you know talking about meeting of the bodies and you know how much we gather together maybe if we didn't talk about this constantly we wouldn't have these separate issues. But God doesn't say to get rid of the mountains. &gt;&gt; God says to get rid of the sin on the mountains. &gt;&gt; And you know the sin, the idolatry on the mountains that you know God says to get rid of it so he can fill it once again and that it could be used for his glory. You know, some of us may have been hurt by what others have taught us, but that doesn't make the teaching itself wrong. It makes the sin behind the teacher teaching it to you. &gt;&gt; We can't throw the baby out with a bath water. &gt;&gt; God has given us ordinances, commands that we should and devote our lives to. But just because someone can teach it to us with the sin in their heart, it doesn't mean that we draw back from God's commands. &gt;&gt; We have to realize that we have to get rid of the sin on the mountain so we can glorify God on these mountains once again. Let's go to Ezekiel 36. &gt;&gt; Let's keep moving. Ezekiel 36. It says in verse 22, \"Therefore say to the house of Israel, this is what the Lord God says. It is not for your sake that I will act, house of Israel, but for my holy name which you profained among the nations where you went.\" See, you know, this passage is powerful. You know, many people want a personal reason why God works in their lives. But this passage does not say that. It says it is not for your sake that I act. So for whose sake does God act? It says his own name's sake. Because it is so easy to act and profane his name in our decision-making. And even for those who don't even necessarily believe in God, God has created you for a purpose. And he wants you to not spread his name badly by abusing your own creation which is your body which is the temple that he has given you. And I believe sometimes we have to understand that God acts for his own names sake. Meaning that he will never compromise for a person. &gt;&gt; God makes decisions for his own name's sake. Everything in your life that doesn't glorify God is not of God. Come on. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want to believe that everything I do, everything I do brings honor and glory to God. But that's not the case. It's it's things that glorify God that glorify God. And so we have to get rid of the things that don't. Amen. And God acts so that his name may be glorified and not profained. So therefore, if it doesn't glorify God, it is not of God. But this is important to know. If we keep reading in verse 24 in Ezekiel 36, it says, \"For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and will bring you into your own lands. I will also sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you. I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will place my spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes and carefully observe my ordinances. You will live in the land that I gave to your ancestors. You will be my people and I will be your God. I will save you from all your uncleanliness. I will summon the grain and make it plentiful and will not bring famine on you. I will also make the fruit of the trees and the produce of the fields plentiful so you will no longer experience reproach among the nations on account of famine. You will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and detestful practices. It is not for your sake that I will act. This is the declaration of the Lord God. Let this be known to you. Be ashamed and humiliated because of your ways, house of Israel. &gt;&gt; Isn't that passage powerful? You know, the Bible says that he will sprinkle clean water on us. He that he will cleanse us of our impurities and iniquities. That he will give us a new heart. Uh the word heart is le and it literally means inner man. that he will change us from the inside out. He will give us a spirit that will cause us to follow his commands. And he will do all of this for you, but not because of you. He does it for his own name's sake. You know, I think what is preached nowadays, this concept of free grace and there's nothing that you can do, I think is a complete misconception of this passage. You know, it's true. We're not earning our salvation. You know, our sins profane God's name. And so therefore, he acts on his own behalf, but we still have to take action. &gt;&gt; You know, the action isn't now deserving or now that we're earning our servation, our salvation, but rather we are being ashamed and accepting the fact that we are a sinner. &gt;&gt; Understanding that our sin professes God's name. And I think many people say out of pretense and in a pseudospiritual way that there's nothing I can do that I'm just a sinner. And maybe in pretense they accept that fact. But when you believe that God acts on your behalf, you miss the point completely. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you know, we talked about, you know, this how people believe that faith is all you need while at the same time they lack the faith in believing in themselves that God has created them to do incredible things that completely repent of your sins. I think this passage is very similar that God, yes, he does everything, but sometimes we focus on the fact that we have to do nothing. But the focus is completely wrong. The focus is that God does everything and therefore all we have to do is we be ashamed. We we we humble ourselves. We fall on our knees and we accept the fact of who we are without God. And I believe when you understand that God acts in his own name's sake, it makes you love him even more. &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. Ezekiel chapter 37. &gt;&gt; We have a lot to cover here. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm messing with you. I'm almost done. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 37 in verse one. &gt;&gt; Uh it says the the hand of the Lord was on me and he brought me out by his spirit and set me down in the middle of the valley. It was full of bones. He led me all around them. There were a great many of them on the surface of the valley and they were very dry. Then he said to me, \"Son of man, can these bones live?\" I replied, \"Lord God, only you know.\" He said to me, \"Prophesy concerning these bones and say to them, dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.\" This is what the Lord God says to these bones. I will cause breath to enter you and you will live. I will put tendons on you, make flesh grow on you and cover you with skin. I will put breath in you so you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord's. You know, this passage I think is is very important. It says he starts off um by having uh Ezekiel go all around and observe the valley of dry bones. And I think it's very important that if we're going to bring life to people, we have to first assess the situation. Amen. But you know, it's hard because this chapter in and of itself deserves its own lesson. But I'm going to do it in a single point. Amen. Uh point number three is you have the words of life. You have the words of life. And these bones, the dry and the dead, it it represents those who have a life without God or have no life before God. And that Ezekiel is being commanded by God to prophesy to them to bring life into them. And I think this is uh a very beautiful concept because here God literally tests his faith. He says, \"Can these bones live?\" I think what happens very commonly just like Ezekiel, we say a very fake spiritual and fake humble answer. God only you know. And that answer that he gave is actually not a faithful answer. He doesn't believe that God could do it. In fact, he say well God I can't answer for you only you know the answer to that. Instead of saying of course God you could do anything to these bones. But so commonly do we resort to this fake pseudospiritual answer? Yeah, God, I'm a sinner. I understand that. But do you understand that you can fully repent of your sins? &gt;&gt; Yes, God, I know I should be sharing my faith. Well, do you believe that you can be fruitful any time of the year? &gt;&gt; You know, all God, you know, I I I yes, you know, you do make every single one of us a leader. Well, do you believe that you can lead more and more as long as you're faithful to me? Like we come up with these pseudo spiritual answers, but really they lack faith in God. &gt;&gt; And we see actually the fruit of that. He had to prophesy to these bones twice. &gt;&gt; Why? Because when he first did it, it was out of half belief. And so they were half healed. &gt;&gt; Literally, they were dry bones. And it said between now and verse 10 that their their bones went together, skin grew on them, tendons grew, but they were still dead. Why? Because Ezekiel didn't fully believe. &gt;&gt; So God had to tell him again. I'm so grateful God gives us second chances. &gt;&gt; If you didn't have faith in him before, if you lacked faith in yourself right now, that you have the chance to make it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's see in verse 10 what what happens. It says that uh so I prophesied once again because God told him to prophesy again as he commanded me. The breath entered them and they came to life and stood on their feet a vast army. You see when God had made and formed Adam in Genesis 2:7 it says that he made Adam one from the ground and two that he breathed the breath of life into his nostrils. So God, what he could have done, it says, I could transform these valley of dry bones into an army with a snap of my finger. I could wave my hand. I could send an angel. But instead, I am going to use you, Ezekiel. I'm going to have you create life just as I did in the beginning when I created Adam. I think it is so important for us to know that we have the words of life. You have to recognize the power that God gives you. The power that God gives all of us to literally create life. That when you share your faith, when you're in a Bible study, when someone becomes a disciple, you are literally making them go from dry bones into enlisted into God's army. &gt;&gt; You are literally making life. And today, we're going to see two young men, Will and Adrian, be added to God's army. [Applause] And I think it's is powerful to see this through, you know, their parents' examples, through uh Jordan and Luna and through Michael that they literally were speaking life into these young men. Let's go continue in Ezekiel 37:22. &gt;&gt; It says, \"I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel and no and one king will rule over all of them. They will no longer be two nations and will no longer be divided into two kingdoms. They will not defile themselves anymore with their idols, their abhorrent things and their transgressions. I will save them from all their apostasies by which they sent. And I will cleanse them. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God. My servant David, once again, Jesus, will be king over them, and there will be one shepherd for all of them. They will follow my ordinances and keep my statutes and obey them. They will live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your ancestors lived. They will live in it forever with their children and their grandchildren. And my servant David will be their prince forever. I will make a covenant of peace with them. And they will be a and it will be a permanent covenant with them. I will establish and multiply them and will set my sanctuary among them forever. My dwelling place will be with them and I will be their God and they will be my people. Then when my sanctuary is among them forever, the nations will know that I the Lord sanctify Israel. See, God promises a time when all his people are gathered from all around the nations. And it is a prophecy of Jesus being the shepherd over all his people. And that you see this picture of this family of God uniting together under one leader. And it's amazing at the very end that that the nations will know once we gather together that God is the one that sanctifies us. But, you know, there's confusion over this passage because it says that I the Lord sanctify Israel, right? It's like, well, I'm I don't know if I'm a descendant of Abraham. I don't think I don't know if any of you guys know. I don't know if I'm a descendant of Abraham, but you know, the question is, well, who is Israel? Who who is who is this one that that gets to be a part of God's family? Well, let's go to Romans 9 and close out here. &gt;&gt; We get to see this promise of God fulfilled today. Romans chapter 9. It's amazing to see all the cross references in the Bible as well. &gt;&gt; It says in verse 6, now it is not as though the word of God has failed because not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. Neither is it the case that all of Abraham's children are his descendants. On the contrary, your offspring will be traced through Isaac. That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but the children of the promise who are considered to be the offspring. Isn't that amazing that if you are today living in God's new covenant through Jesus, you are considered a child of promise. that when the Bible says in Ezekiel that he will sanctify all of Israel is not talking about the blood and the the the reign of you know Abraham but literally us that we are all sanctified by God and it is you know us who realize that if we are children of promise we have to live like children of promise not because of your blood but because of Jesus's blood amen and so I believe today let us live as true Children of promise. What does that mean? It means one who accept that you have the words of life, that you can prophesy, that you can preach, and that at the same time, you don't have to remove these mountains. That you can just take the sin away from these mountains. And that that God, he wants you to lead. He desires all of his people to be leaders. And I think for us today that if we're going to see great things happen in Tampa, that we all have to desire to be leaders. So let us live as true childrens of promise and to God be all the glory.

    "transcript": "[Music] What is confirmation bias? Confirmation bias is the human tendency to find evidence for what we want to believe even if it is not true. I have some incredible quotes for us &gt;&gt; to help us understand the gravity and the poison that is confirmation bias. &gt;&gt; And of course, we'll even look at a scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, one man said, \"The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion draws all things else to support and agree with it.\" Another man said, \"Sometimes we don't want to hear the truth because they don't want to hear their illusions destroyed.\" Uh, another person said, uh, a few years later um, they said people tend to see what they are looking for and to overlook what they are not looking for. You know, funny. Ever since we got I used to think that, you know, certain cars just didn't exist. You know, no one would buy them, that they're just not good. But once you own a car, whatever make of car you have, all of a sudden they stand out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's like, I thought no one bought these cars, but all of a sudden they're everywhere. It's same thing with confirmation bias. Another man said, \"What the human being is best at is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.\" &gt;&gt; You know, confirmation bias, it it can slowly kill you. Proverbs 14 &gt;&gt; verse 12, there is a way that seems right to a person, but its end is the way of death. &gt;&gt; You know, everyone in life is on a journey. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whether you believe in God and you know he's put you on this path in life or even if your belief is unbelief because unbelief is a belief, right? &gt;&gt; You know, you find supporting evidence to why your unbelief is real. You even have key people within your religion of atheism or unbelief that are outstanding critics of why unbelief is true. And they're your preachers, they're your pastors. Unbelief is still a belief. And my point is this is that no one is exempt from being on a journey. No one isn't exempt from having a path in life that they want to follow. And that there are those who believe wholeheartedly in what they are doing. They genuinely believe in what they hold on to devoted, committed, certain and even sincere in their choices in life. But the Bible says that even still the end can be death. &gt;&gt; The end can lead to ruin. Of course, we're going to still continue our Ezekiel series. Go to Ezekiel chapter 29. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And a lot of what we'll be looking at is confirmation bias and how it can slowly kill somebody. Ezekiel chapter 29, the Bible says in verse 8, \"Therefore, this is what the Lord God says, I am going to bring a sword against you and cut off both people and animals from you. The land of Egypt will be a desolate ruin.\" Okay, so before we continue, you know, we finished last time getting together up to chapter 28 and we saw God through the prophet of Ezekiel, the prophet Ezekiel condemn and judge these other neighboring nations. So the last nation that God is left to pronounce judgment on outside of Israel and Judah is Egypt. So we're closing out the seven nations that he announced judgment on with Egypt. She throws in a little blurb with Assyria in there. But now let's see what God has to say about Egypt. &gt;&gt; Then they will know that I am the Lord because you said the Nile is my own. I made it. Therefore, I am against you and your Nile. I will turn the land of Egypt in the ruins, a desolate waste from the Migdal Deser of Kush. No human foot will pass through it and no animal will pass through it. It will be uninhabited for 40 years. I will make the lands of Egypt a desolate a desolation among the desolate lands and its cities will be a desolation among the ruined cities for 40 years. I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them throughout the land. So we'll pause there. You know this passage is quite incredible. And when studying this out and reading this, I'm like, okay, what what can we draw from from this passage? You know, in the past, we've looked at different images. I think last Sunday we had about five. Um, we actually made a, you know, we made a huge investment here &gt;&gt; and [Applause] [Music] so in the sadly there's no images in today's lesson, &gt;&gt; but um, no no no visuals for us, but in the future this pen that is really a pointer we'll be using, you know, and &gt;&gt; I hope you're I hope you're as fired up as I am about this. It just looks like a pen, you know. I thought like it's the the illusion, you know, confirmation bias. Um, but uh, you know, continue on. I was studying this passage and I'm okay, what what can we draw from it? You know, in the past, we've analyzed different things. We've looked at visualizations for different visions, visualizations for different prophecies that God had Ezekiel even enact, right? And what it physically look like, what the temple looked like. And even going to this, you know, we've talked about how God prophesied the downfall of Tyrie last Sunday, right? And how visually literally how how it happened over years after the conquest of Alexander the Great. And I was thinking looking at this, you know, we could dive into that, but I thought there was another message that I thought was so powerful in that because different historians have argued actually if this is true or not. Did it really happen? Our title, not title, but our first point for us is don't be a slave to your own perspective. &gt;&gt; Don't be a slave to your own perspective. Why do I say that? Because the fact that whether you were whether you are a historical uh a secular historian or a theological Christian historian, there have been two very different views on if this passage really happens. And I find what uh the the split was was that those who don't believe in God, they get hung up on when the part that it says that it'll could be completely uninhabited. No human foot, no animal foot will wander through this land. And they hang on that believing in its in its literal sense that zero people will be in the land of Egypt for 40 years. But those who of course believe in God read it from a different perspective of God is using this desolation uh this being completely uninhabited as an allegory a as as a parable to describe the complete downfall of Egypt. How they went from a great nation who other nations bowed down to to being nothing but a wastelands. And not that there are zero people who live in Egypt, but the fact that their transition from greatness to littleness is basically like they've gone down to nothing. And so there's a hangup, right? Like, well, the 40 years is real because people, you know, it went down in their greatness. So it doesn't mean a literal zero people, but more of a parable. But then some say like, well, this prophecy never happened and it never will happen because people still lived in the lands. And it got me really thinking, why do people have these different points of views? They're re we're all reading the same Bible, but some some people view it as like, well, like, let me hang on this uninhabited points and let me like really prove God is wrong because this prophecy never came true. While there are those who fully believe in God and they read it, it's like, no, you're you're not grasping the Bible in its entirety. Let's go to John chapter 5. &gt;&gt; All right. And I I think that pers our perspective is so important to the biases that we choose to believe in. John chapter 5, here's what Jesus has to say to the Pharisees. In verse 36, he says, \"But I have a greater testimony than John's because of the works that the Father has given me to accomplish. These very works I am doing testify about me that the father has sent me. The father who sent me has himself testified uh about me. You have not heard his voice at any time and you haven't seen his form. You don't have his word residing in you because you don't believe the one he sent. You pour over the scriptures because you think you have eternal life in them and yet they testify about me. But you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life. In this passage, Jesus is saying that his actions, his works, his miracles testify about him. That who he says the son of God, the Messiah is true. He said that the father testifies about him. The scriptures testify about him. And that all these different things, they're supposed to lead us to Jesus Christ. And yet the Pharisees pour over the scriptures and completely miss the points. They miss the direction for which all of these, the father, the scriptures, Jesus's miracles, they miss the point of it all. And it's crazy to think that they believe that the scriptures are giving them eternal life while the one who actually does give them eternal life is standing right in front of them. They're completely blinds. And I want you guys to ask yourselves, have you been reading the scriptures, but missing the heart of the scriptures? &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; we can read it, dig into its interpretation, but do we miss the point of where it is supposed to be guiding us? And I believe confirmation bias plays a huge role in that, you know, and we'll dig into this. I think one thing is very important as a disciple is to never have a conversation with someone who doesn't believe in God if they're unwilling to get personal. &gt;&gt; And I I'll never have a conversation with someone who doesn't believe in God if they're unwilling to get personal. Cuz if you're unwilling to get deep and personal, you will always be a slave to your own perspective. You're you're never willing to change what really matters because you might change the surface level. It's like, well, I can intellectually believe in God. I can intellectually understand the scriptures, but at a deep inward level, they will never be willing to change. You know, I believe even as a disciple of Jesus Christ, we can drink the slow poison of confirmation bias when we don't dig deep and get personal to establish biblical truths. You know, you can read the scriptures, follow Jesus steps, but you have no idea where you're going or why you're even going there. Why? Because we miss the heart of the scriptures. And like the Pharisees, they read and they longed for a Messiah. But when he's right in front of us, we call him crazy and try to get rid of him only because he doesn't match our own perspective &gt;&gt; of what we believe we should be doing according to the scriptures. Let's go back to Ezekiel 29 and we'll expand on this a bit more. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter 29. In verse six, what we're going to do to understand this not being a slave to our own perspective, what is confirmation bias? How does it come into our walk with God? Uh looking at this passage, we're going to ask two questions. The first we're going to ask is who is Egypt in this passage? H how does how is the Bible describing Egypt? The second question we're going to ask is who is Egypt in relation to Israel, right? And if you remember from we talked about previously, Egypt represents what? &gt;&gt; Our sin, right? Our sin before we come into disciplehip, right? So in Israel of of course is the children of God. So who is Egypt to Israel is what is sin to the children of God? What is the relationship between the two? In Ezekiel 29:6, this describes their relationship. It says, \"Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the Lord, for they have been a staff made of reed to the house of Israel. When Israel grasped you by the hand, you splintered, tearing all their shoulders. When they leaned on you, you shattered and made all their hips unsteady.\" And in verse 9, it says, \"The land of Egypt will be a desolate ruin. they then they will know that I am the Lord because you said the Nile is my own. I made it. So this is really important, right? So the relationship between Israel and Egypt was that it said it describes Egypt as a as a as a staff of reed, right? So the Egyptians worshiped the sun a lot. And they had a staff that was like the sun where at the very top of it was a circle but around it was like multiple spearheads kind of like beams of light. And what God is saying is that we, you know, lean and put our weight on this staff. Imagine what would happen if you would put your full weight on a spear &gt;&gt; and just leaned on it. Like if you just put it under your shoulder and just put your full weight until you couldn't put your weight anymore, it would take your arm off, right? &gt;&gt; You know, and imagine you come home, you want to relax, and you know, just somehow someway your table has a bunch of knives on it and then you want to put your feet and relax on it. Do you think that your your legs would be in a good condition afterwards? &gt;&gt; Of course not. Right? And what the Bible is saying the relation between Egypt and Israel was that Israel relied on Egypt but in their reliance and leaning on Egypt it shattered them. It destroyed them. It tore their limbs. But who is Egypt? I think this is even more important question. It said that the reason why God is announcing judgment on them is because they said the Nile is my own. I made it. When I think about what describes this statement, I think of two words. I think of prideful and delusional to to think that well the pride the the denial is mine. It belongs to me. But then delusional in the sense of believing that you created it. Like how's that? How do you even fathom that concept &gt;&gt; that that that like imagine like we come in here it's like you know what I made this building. Like you would look at me like I have three heads. Like Malik you you don't even know how to well how what how do you make cement? You don't know anything about that right? How do you make windows? I would not understand architecture. Amen to all the architecture students out there who study super hard have no idea how you do it. Right? Um Jonathan's architecture, you know, and funny enough, two people who came up today are architecture majors, funny enough. Um and so it, you know, it'd be delusional for me to believe that I created something when I had no part in it, right? But I think this is really important because the relationship between the two was that Israel relied on the delusion and pride of their sin. &gt;&gt; And it makes me think of Eve eating from the tree of knowledge, the fruit. How did Eve describe the fruit? Said it was delightful to look at. Pride. Pride is trying to look good. and the delusion of believing that it is good for you. Eve literally said in Genesis that it is good for food and desirable for obtaining wisdom. Literally since the first sin, it was pride and delusion that caused the fall. And now we see it playing out in the fall of Israel, God's people. Pride and delusion. I believe at the core of all confirmation bias is pride and delusion. And the reality is that you actually can get better and you can overcome any sort of pride or delusional way of thinking that you're stuck in. But the answer is by going deeper. You know, I want to shout out the people who have come up in the past to share for communion. &gt;&gt; You know, they've shared a way of thinking that they have brought into their disciplehip. I want to shout Jonathan. &gt;&gt; You know, he he shared a powerful communion and but what was more important that he shared was the victory of overcoming it. That what he had to do was dig deeper in his fear of God. &gt;&gt; He had to get more personal, talk to the brothers, get open and allow himself to dig in ways that he'd never had to dig before and has brought about a greater victory in his walk with God. &gt;&gt; You know, another person who shared in the past was Maria. you know, she she shared about o overcoming, you know, the sins in her life, specifically uh what what brought her to realize different things that she thought that should be a part of her walk with God. bring into the things uh uh in her relationship with God that shouldn't have be there but yet by digging deeper taking time to get personal her walk with God able to overcome &gt;&gt; and the many people that have shared I appreciate Megan who's come up for shared for communion &gt;&gt; for Kyle who shared for communion and you get to hear these great victories of what happens when you dig deeper &gt;&gt; these great victories when you you don't allow yourself to be led by thoughts that you think should be a part of your disciplehip ship and you're looking for evidence to support it, but instead digging deeper for what is really true. &gt;&gt; Digging deeper for what God really says. &gt;&gt; You know, the the rest of these chapters 29 to 32, you know, they're all on Egypt's downfall. And there's so many incredible uh Bible nuggets that that you can find in these next few chapters. And I think very similar to the confirmation bias, funny enough, that whatever you're looking for, you will find. And I believe that when even reading the scriptures, if you're looking for great insight, you're going to find great insight. &gt;&gt; But if you open your Bible to start your quiet time just because you're you have to, you're literally living out a self-fulfilling prophecy because you're not going into into your quiet time looking for something, &gt;&gt; looking for insights, looking for wisdom, looking for ways to change. And so, of course, you close your Bible and you believe that like maybe there's no substance. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. And maybe you blame God, you blame something, you blame yourself, but really it's how you're going into it. It's your own perspective. You become a slave to your own perspective. But we're going to move forward here uh and go to Ezekiel chapter 33. &gt;&gt; I believe there's lots of great wisdom in these next few chapters that I could really hone in on one before going to the next one. So, this will actually be our our last chapter that we'll look at um that we're going to go in depth on because the next few chapters are dense. I'll be honest, very dense. Uh point number two, the word entertains or it maintains. &gt;&gt; The word entertains or it maintains. Ezekiel chapter 33 in verse 11, the Bible reads, \"Tell them as I live, this is the declaration of the Lord God. I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked person should turn from his way and live. Repent. Repent of your evil ways. Why will you die, house of Israel? You know, this chapter is actually very similar. The beginning is very similar to chapter 3 where God is telling Ezekiel that he is now a watchman over Israel. And it later on we see this verse where yes God is announcing judgment on his people but God takes no pleasure in them dying in their sin. &gt;&gt; You know a parent though they have to punish their children they don't take enjoyment in it. &gt;&gt; They don't find it pleasing to do it but they know they they have to. And I think it's amazing that even God understands this for us living these walks with our walk with God that you know there are things that maybe we don't really necessarily feel like we want to do but we know we have to do &gt;&gt; and God does the same thing. Ezekiel 33:12, the very next verse. &gt;&gt; This is a very powerful verse. It says, \"Now, son of man, say to your people, the righteousness of the righteous person will not save him on the day of his transgression. Neither will the wickedness of the wicked person cause him to stumble on the day he turns from his wickedness. The righteous person won't be able to survive by his righteousness on the day he sins.\" When I tell the righteous person that he will surely live, but he trusts in his righteousness and acts unjustly, then none of his righteousness will be remembered, and he will die because of the injustice he has committed. So when I tell the wicked person, you will surely die. But he repents of his sin and does what is just and right. He returns collateral, makes restitution for what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without committing injustice. He will surely live. He will not die. None of the sins he committed will be held against him. He has done what is just and right. He will certainly live. But your people say the Lord's way isn't fair, even though it is their own way that isn't fair. You know, I I have never fully grasp that was, you know, you can grasp it to a sense, but I've never fully grasped how someone could stand up here on a Sunday, preach a sermon to people telling them that once you're saved, you're okay. That once you're saved, you will always be saved. And they preach this message of eternal security. and that this slow poison of confirmation bias only builds it and makes it worse. You know, I right now we're going to speak on actually the history of how this once saved always saved doctrine came about in the population of many churches. But I hope that as we speak the truth as it is that we don't hold any disdain towards anyone who believes in these different things that we have nothing but love cuz we know how we were when we were in darkness. how we were when we were blinded by our own sin. And so that when we speak the truth plainly, we still have love for those who don't understand us, &gt;&gt; love for those who don't see us. &gt;&gt; And I hope that by going into the the history of the how it came to be that we could find uh I I guess uh a sense of wonder of you know this is interesting you know like I never learned it that way. Um you know in in the 4th century uh St. Augustine of Hippo, right? So he he is a a man who has been venerated as a saint according to the Catholic Church. He started writing these sayings to oppose another man named Plagiius who was in the church. But because of this situation between the two, he was later excommunicated from the church and regarded as a heretic and a blasphemer. Right? But I want to read to you some of his quotes that I think are quite interesting that he said and why they considered him uh a heretic. One thing he said uh in his book nature and grace he said when God gave to man freedom of the will he gave him the greatest possible gift the capacity for good or evil. This is grace. See what happened of what sparked this revolution of once saved always saved starting back to the 4th century was that this man Plagiius looked amongst the church and saw a spiritual laziness amongst the people. People who would come to church, listen to the word, have whatever time they had with whoever was preaching the gospel to them, but then leave and do nothing about their lives. &gt;&gt; So he made an assessment. He's saying you know what people actually have to make the decision to change that is not just about grace but he gave an emphasis to free will the decision to repent the decision to follow God out of your own choices but St. Augustine opposed this. He opposes believing well it's actually not about free will. It's about grace. But let's see some of Py's other quotes. He said, \"We distinguish three things. Ability, will, and act. The ability we place in nature. The will and the act we ascribe to man. The ability to do good has been given to us by God. But to will and to act we do ourselves.\" Um, basically what he's saying is that yes, God, the grace that God gave us is the ability to change the fact that we can come to Jesus. We can come to God. However, we have to make the decision to. The other thing he said, he says we can do all that God has commanded us since God has given us the capacity to do it. Christ is our teacher, showing us by his teaching and example how to live rightly. And St. Augustine's response to this is quite interesting. He says, \"The Lord did not only give us commandments, but also bestowed his spirit that we might keep what he commands. For without him, we can do nothing.\" They both actually sound seemingly right. I remember one day though I was studying the Bible with this man and this guy came out of left field came out of nowhere and he literally said, \"Hey, is this person that you're reading the scriptures with, are they a believer? Are they a Christian?\" I was like, \"No, actually I'm trying to help him become one.\" And this is what we said immediately after. He says, \"Then why are you teaching him?\" He says, \"He doesn't have the Holy Spirit. He's unteachable.\" &gt;&gt; And I was like, \"But then how does he gain a knowledge of the truth? H how does he come into a relationship with Jesus? Are you saying it's purely off of ignorance, purely off of zero knowledge? I was a little confused by that reasoning. And from that point on, it was kind of a blur. But this is the extent of that belief. The extent that there is nothing that you can do within your free will to repent of your sins and come into a relationship that is all based off of external factors and nothing that you can control. But there is a strong danger in that and we see that played out in how John Calvin who started the Calvinist denomination of Christianity adopted this way of thinking from St. Augustine. And you know after John Calvin died the five points of Calvinism labeled tulip was created by all of his followers who got together for a big conference and just took all of his writings and made five core things of what he said. And the P in tulip stands for perseverance of the saints. And here's exactly what John Calvin said. He said, \"Those who fall away have never oh, those who fall away have never been thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of Christ and with the true faith. For had they ever truly known the sweetness of grace, they uh could never have abandoned it.\" And so the belief system is literally that if you fall away from God, it means you never had it in the first place, which is quite interesting because that's not what I get from the scripture. But that's the 16th century, right? That's about 12 centuries after St. Augustine. But let's look at it in terms of recent times, right? So between the 18th and 20th century, there is an American revival amongst uh Christian believers. And that this topic of eternal security once saved all the saved was adopted by uh the Baptist churches and many different but not all um uh uh autonomous evangelical churches. Right? So this was said during the Baptist convention of 1833. Those who have been regenerated will never totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace. Another man said named Charles Stanley says even if a believer this is actually crazy even if a believer for all practical purposes becomes an unbeliever his salvation is not in jeopardy. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Someone I want I'll read it again. Even if a believer for all practical purposes becomes an unbeliever, his salvation is not in jeopardy. Okay, here's actually where the saying once saved always saved. It actually came from the previous president named Aaron Roger, Adrien Rogers of the SBC. He said once saved always saved. If saved, always saved. If ever saved, always saved. &gt;&gt; So even the saying, once saved, always saved is actually an unfinished quote. It continues on, if saved, always saved. If ever saved, always saved. And you see this slow poison that is confirmation bias wanting to confirm your current state of life without digging deep in establishing truths according to the scriptures. You know what makes a man turn from his righteousness according to this passage in verse 13 it says trusting in his righteousness. What causes a person to turn away from the light that God has them in is they trust in their previous righteousness to the point of trying to condone their current sin. &gt;&gt; That is the danger and that is falling away. And it's quite interesting because the amount of times I've been persecuted trying to tell people about this message is quite astounding. But it matches exactly what the Bible says in their response. It says that isn't fair. Literally in verse 17, that isn't fair. You know, we have a brother, we have a brother who uh led Turning Point USA, the chapter for where he went to school, right? And he literally invited Charlie Kirk, who, you know, obviously is the owner of uh Turning Point USA, for the sole reason of debating him on baptism. And so there's a video that went viral. Um, and uh, it's quite interesting because what he's presenting to him is, \"Hey Charlie, the Bible says pretty clearly that you be baptized for the forgiveness of your sins.\" And I want you to think of the first reaction that many people, not all, many people turn to is they give an analogy rather than a scripture of saying what happens to those on their deathbed who have had no they have no time and no chance to repent. And what they're pointing to is if that were to happen, God isn't fair. And I want you to read in this passage, what do people say in response to you can actually no matter how much righteousness you've built up turning to sin and dying in your sin, all your righteousness is forgotten. It literally says in verse 17, \"But your people say the Lord's way isn't fair.\" Guys, this has been happening since the beginning of time. People struggling with the fairness and the justness that is God's judgments. that is his scriptures. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so important for us to really grasp because in verse 14 it literally says the opposite that if a wicked person does turn and does what is just and right in verse 15 says he returns collateral makes restitution for what he has stolen. He walks in the statutes of life without committing injustice. You know, God believes that you can walk in his statutes. God believes that you can walk righteously. &gt;&gt; And I find this to be a huge issue that for those who claim that it is all about belief have the least amount of belief in what God created them to do. &gt;&gt; Talk about it. And so they emphasize faith, but they have the biggest lack of faith that God has designed them to do, which is walk righteously. &gt;&gt; And I think it is so important to realize how easy it is to take in this poison. And what is this poison? Not believing in yourself. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. &gt;&gt; Not believing that you can repent. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not believing that you can be a faithful disciple. You know, uh what did Tom say when he came up here? He saw the disciples who have persevered and persevered and kept on going, kept on finding strength no matter what happened around them. And they kept pushing through and it helped them realize that he can do it too. &gt;&gt; You know, we are a church here that spreads what is true. And the truth is that you can overcome &gt;&gt; that you can repent of your sins. That people tell you that once they've always saved. Why? Because they don't believe in you. &gt;&gt; God believes in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. God believes that you can repent. He believes that you can obey his scriptures. Let's go out and close in Ezekiel 33:30. &gt;&gt; You know, uh this this passage, uh I almost felt like I read it for the first time. Maybe it's because of the translation that I'm reading, but it is so incredibly insightful. In chapter 33 and verse 30 of Ezekiel, it says, \"As for you, son of man, your people are talking about you near the city walls and on and in the doorways of their houses. One person speaks to another, each saying to his brother, come and hear what the message is that comes from the Lord.\" So my people come to you in crowds, sit in front of you, hear your words. But they don't obey them. Their mouths go on passionately, but their hearts pursue dishonest prophets. Yes, to them you are like a singer of passionate songs who has a beautiful voice and plays skillfully on instrument. They hear your words but they don't obey them. Yet when all this comes true, and it definitely will, then they will know that a prophet has been among them. You know, God's word can either entertain you or it can maintain in you. &gt;&gt; And the difference, it's a very clear distinction is do you obey his word? &gt;&gt; If you show up to Sunday services, you show up to Bible studies, Bible discussions, midweeks, mentoring, discipling times, and it's all just purely entertainment. Why? Because you don't listen to the scriptures that are being presented to you. I want to ask you, do you take notes when you hear the lessons? &gt;&gt; And the reality is I I'll just share why I take notes. &gt;&gt; I take notes because I have a bad memory. &gt;&gt; And and it's it is said that by writing it down, you remember 30% more. &gt;&gt; And so why do I take notes? Cuz I want to remember what I heard. &gt;&gt; I want to I want to do what it was just asked of me. Not because of any person, but because of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he believes that I could actually change. Come on. You &gt;&gt; know, it's important not to be entertained by the message, but to maintain it in our hearts. You know, if it is your first time here, God wants you to obey his word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If you've been coming around, God wants you to obey his word. &gt;&gt; If you've been a disciple for 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 40 years, if it is your last day on earth, God wants you to obey his word &gt;&gt; no matter what. And I believe that we can do that and we can be sure to always do that by making sure we don't drink the slow poison that is confirmation bias. &gt;&gt; Believing that our our past righteousness condones our current sins. Believing that we don't have to be open. We don't have to be vulnerable. Those are total lies from Satan because we have to dig deep to have firm convictions in God's word. &gt;&gt; So let's get open. Let's be honest. Let's get personal. But first and foremost, let us obey God's word. To God be all the glory. [Music] [Laughter] [Music]",

    "transcript": "You know, we've been covering the book of uh Ezekiel, right? And we're we're about halfway there. Uh we're a little over with this lesson. We'll be a little over halfway there. Um so we've come so far, guys. &gt;&gt; Hope that encourages you that we've that we've covered most of Ezekiel and we actually understand it. I know the first time I read the book of Ezekiel, I was &gt;&gt; like, what is happening? You know, &gt;&gt; perspective on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, it's quite incredible because for Job, you know, all was given to him for the glory of God. And it's the same thing. Everything was taken from him to the glory of God. &gt;&gt; And I want us to remember that as we go into this this lesson. Let's go to Ezekiel chapter 23. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter 23. I only have uh two points for us. Um and the first one will seem so long you might think I'm done, but then I have a second point. &gt;&gt; But the but the second point will be short. Don't worry. Come on. &gt;&gt; In Ezekiel chapter 23, um just like uh Kyle read in chapter 16 and he said that there are parts of Ezekiel that are very graphic and it paints an image that I'll be honest, it's really hard to say even out loud. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I would really suggest reading it because why is it so graphic is because God is trying to accurately bless you, personify what is happening to his people. Um, but we're going to jump to verse four in chapter 23. It says, um, this is a description that God gives describing the northern and southern kingdom, Israel and Judah. It says, \"The older one was named Oh, and her sister was Oh Liba. They became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, Aha represents Samaria and Oh Liba represents Jerusalem. You know, it's really good when God gives parables and then he gives you its meaning right after. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to dig and search and look up how many commentaries do I have to find out what who is a holy, but says it right there, right? And so a whole lot says is Samaria and specifically Samaria was the capital of Israel when all of Israel split in half and there was the northern kingdom which is which was 10 tribes and the southern kingdom which was two tribes. The capital of the top 10 was Samaria and the capital of the lower two was uh Jerusalem. And each of these names actually have significance. So, oh talking about Samaria, the northern kingdom, uh the name literally means her tent. But this is really important. Why would God call Samaria her tent? Well, because when the kingdom split in half, the temple was in the southern kingdom. So, they didn't have their own temple in the northern kingdom. So, they worshiped God in their own way. &gt;&gt; They had their own way, their own tent, their own place of worship. And specifically, it's on every high hill. If you remember in John chapter 4 when the Samaritan woman says, you know, you worship in the temple, but we worship on the mountain, &gt;&gt; right? They had their own place of worship outside of where God designated them to worship him. And when you look into it specifically, they had these golden calves in Dan and in Bethl. This is really significant because if you guys remember when they left Egypt and Moses was on the mountain speaking to God, getting his commandments, he hears what sounded like to him like a war cry. He comes down and sees people worshiping a golden calf. &gt;&gt; And so they had that golden calf built from what God gave them from their treasures. And Moses had them uh destroy it and then drink the water with its particles in there. Right? And then here's what's crazy is that later down the line in Judges, once Moses is gone and Joshua is gone, they rebuild those calves. &gt;&gt; They literally do exactly what God told them not to do and punish them for. And so it's literally they got rid of sin, but they dug their sin back out from the grave &gt;&gt; and worshiped in this way. uh oh Liba uh represents Jerusalem which was the capital of Judah the southern two kingdoms and uh that name literally means my tent is in her so obviously this is referring to the temple being there right God's temple actually being with Jerusalem but this is significant because even though God's physical presence was there right that's where his temple he designed it where it would be they still chose to worship in their own personal way and as we read previously they even use this temple for their own worship which is very significant. But the part I want to uh really hone in on when you keep going in verse 5 it says oh acted like a prostitutes even though she was mine. She lusted after her lovers the Assyrians warriors dressed in blue governors and prefects all of them desirable young men horsemen riding on ste. She offered her sexual favors to them. All of them were the elite of Assyria. She defiled herself with all those she lusted after and with all their idols. She didn't give up her promiscuity that began in Egypt. We're going to use that phrase and think about the phrase the rest of this point. She didn't give up her promiscuity that began in Egypt. Point number one, what are you holding on to? &gt;&gt; What are you holding on to? You know, I believe it is very important for every disciple to understand and know how to teach the significance of the Exodus. &gt;&gt; Um uh uh Nebby, can you pull up the first image for us? &gt;&gt; Oh, we're I have five images for us today. &gt;&gt; Um but sadly, no pointer. Um we'll we'll get the pointer one day. &gt;&gt; Um but Nebby, whenever you're &gt;&gt; Come on, Nebby. Ready? &gt;&gt; Awesome. Cool. Um, so you have the the Israelites, right? They left Egypt. And what were they in Egypt? &gt;&gt; Slaves, right? They're slaves for 400 years. And you know, through Moses, God, you know, redeems them. He has a plan to save them. And they get to the Red Sea and they feel like, oh no, like we're stuck. We're trapped. But God through his Holy Spirit and his power uses Moses to split the Red Sea open. And they pass through on dry land. They didn't go over the water, walk on the water. They walked on the land and the sea splits. So when all the Israelites passed through basically Well, that's awesome. Um ba basically the Egyptians, Pharaoh and his army came after them. And then once they were in the middle of the sea, then all the water went back down and killed all them. And then obviously then they make they make it through. They have the spirit experience become a new people and it says Mount Si, but you know it's talking about the promised land, right? And it literally says committed to obey God. I didn't make this by the way, just so you know. Like this this is something that you find. I mean like I use images and to help me in my quiet I'm a visual learner. Everyone's like a different kind of learner. You know what I mean? People &gt;&gt; learn best like through auditory like they hear it. &gt;&gt; They learn best by like hands-on experience. I learned by seeing images. &gt;&gt; Um so hopefully this is helpful for you too. Um but literally they escaped slavery, pass through the sea. The sea wipes out all those that are chasing them and now they're on their way to the promised lands. Uh can you show us the next picture, Nebby, please? &gt;&gt; Let's go, Nebby. &gt;&gt; Okay, so this is really cool, right? This is why I think it's really important for every disciple to understand and know how to teach the significance of the Exodus. Right? Remember, &gt;&gt; I didn't make this. &gt;&gt; The moment someone really digs deep and they understand the significance of what happens in the Exodus, they are lying without a doubt that you have to be baptized. &gt;&gt; It is obviously clear, right? And so, a person leaves the world behind. What were they in Egypt? &gt;&gt; And what are we in the world? &gt;&gt; Slaves. &gt;&gt; Slaves to our sin. &gt;&gt; We leave behind. We go through the waters of baptism. &gt;&gt; And then what happens? You know, when Egypt, they went into the waters with them. The water crushed them. And so here, our sins are wiped away. &gt;&gt; They're gone. &gt;&gt; And then of course it says you receive the Holy Spirit. And it l says you're committed to follow Jesus. It's pretty awesome, right? &gt;&gt; And you know, you can literally prove that baptism is a command of God without using any New Testament scriptures. &gt;&gt; It's pretty awesome, right? &gt;&gt; Um, but you know, this is really important, right? Because the world I is supposed to be the the symbol of Egypt or Egypt per se is the symbol of the world. So when the Bible says she didn't give up her promiscuity that began in Egypt, &gt;&gt; that is they that is like saying you took your sin with you. &gt;&gt; You wanted to get baptized but you brought that sin into your disciplehip. &gt;&gt; It came along with you. Awesome. &gt;&gt; And you know it's it's quite significant to uh really think about this because you know God is here in this passage uh or talking about judgment because of their sin right and what's happening the wrath of God is coming but we're talking about the Exodus and where they're promised skew that came since Egypt the time right now where uh Elijah is speaking is a little bit before the uh sacking the final sacking of Jerusalem in 586. So the time between 586 and when they left Egypt is 1300 years, 1,300 years. So it's not like they brought their sin over. They committed a single act and God smoked them. He waited 1,300 years &gt;&gt; for them to repent. &gt;&gt; Isn't that crazy to think about? Um, let's go to second Peter chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Awesome. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter 3, it says in verse 8, &gt;&gt; \"Dear friends, don't overlook this one fact. With the Lord, one day is like a thousand years, &gt;&gt; and a thousand years like one day. The Lord does not delay his promise as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance. &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord is patient with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, he he waited 1300 years to finally say, \"All right, this has to be finished. This is done.\" And you know patience as we know it means longsuffering. &gt;&gt; The Lord is suffering waiting for us to come to repentance. You know I think about me right and the example of you know bringing along uh sins from Egypt from our old life into disciplehip. And I've done that myself personally times in my own walk with God where I'm feeling doubt about myself doubt about my self-worth. Am I really capable of doing things and helping other people? Am I really capable of being a a wife not wife, being a husband to my wife? &gt;&gt; No. Uh being being a father to my daughter. Like am I am I really capable of helping other people? &gt;&gt; Things like lacking joy. One one of my biggest issues was being apathetic in life and just like letting the joy just leave me. Finding any reason to not be joyful. whether it be being impure, having fits of rage. I remember about two years into my disciplehip, um something that came up that I never I never had to deal with um um since I studied the Bible was hatred toward my biological father. Um and all of a sudden I was struggling with it again. um greed, the love of money, selfishness, and in all these different things sadly that I've given into in my disciplehip. It says that God is patient with me &gt;&gt; and that God is patient with you guys. &gt;&gt; And however, we cannot use the Lord's patience as an excuse. &gt;&gt; And it literally says that my sin makes God suffer. He is in longsuffering waiting for my patience. Acts 20:28 says that God purchased you with his blood. &gt;&gt; And that literally the the cost of us coming to God is his own blood. Him shedding his blood. And I want you guys to ask yourself, what sins have you held on to? What sins have you brought over from Egypt, from your old life that you have brought into your current disciplehip? &gt;&gt; Um, and you know, God is patient with you. God is patient with us. But patience and tolerance are not the same thing. &gt;&gt; They are not the same thing. And we have to learn to of course repent of our sins. But if we're going to learn that, we have to believe that. Like, do do you really believe? And not a rhetorical question. have to believe that you cannot commit these sins anymore. &gt;&gt; That you cannot give in to these acts anymore. That any way of thinking, any way of feeling about yourself, any sort of act or action or something that you do, you can actually fully repent of. You know, when God was speaking to Cain right before he was about to commit uh the first sin of murder against his brother, he said that sin is crouching at your door and it wishes to have you. Says, \"But you must master it.\" &gt;&gt; You know, we have to learn to master our sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, God is patient with us because it takes time to become a master. Amen. And he he's he's waiting. You know what? like it's going to happen, but I need you to learn that you cannot live in this anymore. You have to actually repent. Amen. You know, um going back to uh Ezekiel here, uh you know, the other sister was Oh Liba, which represents Jerusalem, the capital of Judah of the southern kingdom. And it's quite interesting because though they had the temple, they did worse acts than the northern kingdom of Israel because they not only as it said lusted after the Assyrians, but they did that plus uh went after the Babylonians as well before they captured them. And uh you know, we just learned that Egypt is symbolic in the Old Testament of our old life, our our previous sins, our previous slavery before becoming baptized disciples. But it talks about Assyria and Babylon in a different way. If Egypt is our old previous sins that we've done before and we've chosen to repent of, Assyria and Babylon are new sins in our life. &gt;&gt; Wow. that we didn't do in our previous life, but we're now doing and committing in our walk with God now &gt;&gt; that we haven't done before. Um, you don't have to turn there, but stay stay in Ezekiel uh 23, but in 2 Kings chapters 15-1 17, it actually defines what God meant by lusting after the Assyrians. Um, you can write these down. Chapter 15:1 19 uh it says that one of the kings of Israel he demanded tri tribute from the prominent men of Israel to pay the king of Assyria to support him specifically in what it says to have a strong grasp on the kingdom. Um, in chapter 16:7, uh, a king of Judah, it says that he had a few cities captured, crazy enough, by the northern kingdom, Israel, and he took gold and silver from the temple. Same thing, gave it to the Assyrian king so that the Assyrian king could help him take that land back. Right? Chapter 17:3 of 2 Kings, uh, the the tables flipped. Now, Assyria, it said that they attacked Samaria, um the capital of the northern kingdom. He made the king pay tribute, but the king didn't want to pay tribute anymore. So, what he did was he went to Egypt, asking for Egypt for help. But before he could even get there, it said that Assyria laid siege on Samaria and totally overtook it and brought them into exile. So the Babylonians took over the southern kingdom of Judah, but the Assyrians were the one that took over the northern kingdom of Israel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know, here's what Israel and Judah uh here's how Israel and Judah prostituted themselves to Israel. And you know, specifically for us, uh the new sins that we bring into our disciplehip, what is the correlation? &gt;&gt; Right? So what they did was number one they believed that the Assyrians would strengthen them. And this is important you know because sometimes there may be bitterness in your walk with God right now. Uh there may be a struggle of maybe not loving another brother or sister. Um it could be not giving contribution for different reasons. But what happens is you start to believe that these things will actually make you stronger by not giving to God. I keep more money for myself and therefore if I can glorify myself, myself looks better and therefore I'm a better disciple because of it. You know, if I set up boundaries between myself and other brothers and sisters, which there are good boundaries and there are ones that you literally selfisolate yourself, but you believe that you're strengthening yourself that you've never done this in the world, but now you're doing it in God's kingdom. You're doing exactly what they did here in this passage. You know the other thing that they did in 16 chapter 16:7 is you they used Assyria to solve their problems. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so once again Assyria and Babylon represent new sins in our walk with God. So maybe you know you've repented of debauchery, you've repented of impurity, repented of hatred, you know going after uh repented of of your pride, right? But you know, instead of going to the word on how to deal with these things, you now have a new sin of how you cope with your struggles, whether it be gossip. You now you now become a gossip. You you don't you're not debaucherous anymore, but maybe now you're a gossip talking to other people about other people in the church in a way that actually doesn't lift them up. &gt;&gt; You know, maybe you become divisive, right? You cause division amongst your brothers and sisters. Maybe you start to victim blame. You know, maybe in the world you thought you were strong, you thought you were the best, you thought you were tough, but now that you're in the kingdom, you develop this new sin of becoming the constant victim. &gt;&gt; And that is now the Assyria and the Babylon in your life. &gt;&gt; The third thing they did was they used Egypt to try and save themselves from Assyria. You know, sin is sin whether it's new or old. Amen. But something happens to your your soul, to your inner self when you know, you try to combine those two. You combine old sin and you combine new sin. And here's what I mean. When somebody is struggling with, let's say, discouragement, lack of faith, and they never had to necessarily deal with that in their previous life. But then on top of that, to deal with their discouragement, to deal with their lack of faith, I I think many of us know people who have fallen away doing this. Were they given to immorality? &gt;&gt; Those people shipwreck their faith. &gt;&gt; Where is this related to the passage? Because in 2 kings in 17 when they went to Egypt to save themselves from the Assyrians, that is when Assyria took them captive, destroyed the northern kingdom and took captives into Assyria. That is when uh Israel was wiped out specifically when they tried to use their old life to save them from their new life which were both wicked. You know, I this happens sometimes too, whether someone gets bitter. They're they're they're they have anger towards another brother or sister or whether it be um you know, they give into believing that persecution is real and they have all this doubt and then you know what happens is they present all this stuff. Well, it's this person, it's that person, it's this issue. But there's so many times where that has happened in the church and they leave and within a few days they have a new boyfriend or girlfriend. &gt;&gt; Talk about it. &gt;&gt; Why? because they're running back to their old life. &gt;&gt; They they have this new sin of bitterness and doubt and they try to solve it with Egypt. &gt;&gt; Running back to Egypt. Guys, these problems have literally happened for thousands upon thousands of years. &gt;&gt; Nothing is new, &gt;&gt; you know. And once again, I want you guys to ask yourself, right, what are you holding on to? &gt;&gt; What are you holding on to? See, at first the Israelites, they thought and in Judah as well, they thought that Assyria would help them. But we just read the Bible says the the Lord gives and the Lord takes away. You know, their mistake was that people didn't recognize uh the difference between what was from God and what was their sin. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; They saw, well, if Assyria helps me, then maybe this is good. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I find a common mistake that we have is we literally call good bad and bad good in the church &gt;&gt; specifically because we're now committing new sins that we never did from when before we were disciples &gt;&gt; and it'll shipwreck your disciplehip. &gt;&gt; It'll destroy your faith. You know, I believe in the church our Assyria and our Babylon are sins that we don't recognize until they take us out. Wow. &gt;&gt; You know, um I don't know about you, but when I think about like sins that could take me out and I may not even realize it, I get indignant. I got to be careful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I got to stay alert. I got to be on watch. I got to be humble because if a brother comes to me and tries to give me advice and I immediately dismiss it because I have a scripture that supports my way of thinking and I don't want to hear his way of thinking that that could take me out. Maybe not this month, maybe not this year, but down the line. We have to be extremely careful. &gt;&gt; You know, one brother at the conference uh he preached that his number one fear in life is believing he is saved when he is not. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That is his number one fear and he preached on it. I I I was convicted. It was it was a a a quick comment that he made and I was like I never thought about that. the being literally feeling deep in my soul that I am saved but I am not. You know, I I think that we have to be indignant about sin. &gt;&gt; And as the Bible says, make every effort, &gt;&gt; make every single effort. In Ezekiel chapter 24, let's keep reading. &gt;&gt; It says in verse two, uh, \"Son of man, write down today's date. This very day the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. Now speak a parable to the rebellious house. Tell them this is what the Lord God says. Put the pot on the fire. Put it on and then pour water into it. Place the pieces of meat in it. Place every good piece thigh and shoulder. Fill it with choice bones. Take the choices of the flock and also pile up fuel under it. Bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it. That sounds like a pretty good slowcooked meal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh verse six. Uh therefore, this is what the Lord God says. Woe to the city of bloodshed. The pot that has corrosion inside it, and its corrosion has not come out of it. Empty it piece by piece. Lot should not be cast for its contents. For the blood she shed is still within her. She put it out on the bare rock. She didn't pour it on the ground to cover it with dust in order to stir up wrath and make vengeance. I have put her blood on the bare rock so that it would be so it would not be covered. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says. Woe to the city of blood. Should I myself will make the pile of kindling large? Pile on the logs and kindle the fire. Cook the meat well and mix in the spices. Let the bones be burned. Set the empty pot on its coal so that it bones so that it becomes hot and copper it copper glows when its impurity will melt inside it. Uh its corrosion will be consumed. It has frustrated every effort. Its thick corrosion will not come off into the fire with it corrosion because of the depravity of your unclean of cleanliness. Since I tried to purify you, but you would not be purified from your uncleanliness, you will not be pure again until I have satisfied my wrath on you. I, the Lord, have spoken. It is coming and I will do it. I will not refrain. I will not show pity. I will not relent. I will judge you according to your ways and deeds. This is the declaration of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord gives. The Lord takes away. The Lord heals and the Lord harms. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, this is an interesting passage because it's comparing right now Judah to a pot. And it's like, yeah, God wanted to make this great, amazing, delicious meal with it, right? Doing the choice bones, you know, like you ever see those videos where people they have like the cows like bone marrow and they like have it and they eat it. aesthetically it looks kind of gross but you know it's flavorful you know like it's going to be delicious right and they have this slowcooked meal for them and that's what God is preparing he he he's trying to use Israel and Judah for his glory right but it said that the pot was corroded &gt;&gt; um and this is significant you know because it said empty it piece by piece it says that lot should not even be casted for its contents meaning all the food that was just made slowcooked over hours is now useless. You don't want to have it. It's not good for you. And it talks about is the blood being on the rock. It what it's really saying is that their bloodshed, their sinful acts were obvious for everyone to see. They didn't put it on the ground and covered with dirt. They laid it like if you put if there's blood on like a massive boulder like you can't like just like move the boulder like it's it's there. Like everyone can now see it, right? But then God basically goes on that statement for himself to say, \"Hey, since your sin was for obvious for everyone to see, I'm going to make my wrath on you obvious for everyone to see.\" It kind of makes me think of Luke 14, right? That those who do not count the costs, you know, what does it say? Like everyone around you will ridicule you, right? It's the same exact thing, &gt;&gt; right? Um and then it continues on, right? Says that they have frustrated every effort. You know, we learned previously that God would send prophet after prophet after prophet and yet they still would not repent. And it said that God turned up the heat, tried to purify them, but they would not be purified. You know, the this corrosion that it's talking about is rust. It's quite simply rust, right? That's literally the the Hebrew word for it. And you know, it's interesting. When you try to make food with a rusty pot or pan, &gt;&gt; do you know what happens to that food? tastes bad. &gt;&gt; It tastes gross. It doesn't even poison you. It doesn't kill you. Nothing happens to you physically. It's just a little too much iron oxide in your food, right? But now what happens is the food that was meant to be delicious and tasty now just tastes like the pot. &gt;&gt; It's quite quite interesting to think about, right? But you know what it is? I think we have to be really careful in thinking uh is that it was put in Israel, right? God gave Israel all these gifts so that it could taste the way he wanted it to. But once he put it in, because of all the corrosion and rust, it tasted like the pot. It tasted like Israel. So it's literally God gives us gifts. He g as Mar gives us talents, all these blessings, but what happens is we use it not for God's glory, but our own personal glory. And it not it's not like it becomes poisonous. It kills you. It just doesn't taste the way God designed it to be &gt;&gt; for your own glory. And you know, I think it's important, right? I want you guys to think about what are the ways that God is trying to use you right now. &gt;&gt; Well, what are the ways that God is trying to, you know, show his glory through you? And you know, and he does that by giving you these different gifts. And he says, \"What are you going to do with this? What are you going to do with this family I've given you? What are you going to do with this wife?\" Whether it be all the newlyweds, whether it be kids, whether it be this great job, whether it be finances, what are you going to do with what I am giving you. And what happens though is we use it for our own personal glory, our own personal security. God, you gave me this great job, but I I think I have to be secure by the money you've given me. Trust in the money you've given me rather than you, Lord. God, I know you want me to have peace that comes from righteousness, from from being a man of God, but I I would rather have my peace come from, you know, driving other people away from me. And God gives us these gifts, but then we try to use it for our own personal purpose. You know, I think it's really important, you know, when it comes to what are you holding on to, not to hold on to your own personal way of life. And that, you know, God, especially when God is trying to make it clear through the scriptures. Amen. You know, I'm not telling you God's trying to make it clear to you by some miraculous dream that you have one night, you know, or some, you know, random person comes up to you and starts like saying gibberish, right? But clear through the scriptures on the direction that God wants you to go. And I promise you, the direction God wants you to go is always upward. &gt;&gt; It's always closer to him. You know in chapter 24 in verse 15, remember the Lord gives, the Lord takes away. &gt;&gt; When the word of the Lord came to me, son of man, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you with a fatal blow, but you must not lament or weep or let your tears flow. Groan quietly. Do not observe mourning rights for the dead. Put on your turban. Strap your sandals to your feet. Do not cover your mustache or eat the bread of mourers. I spoke to the people in the morning and my wife died in the evening. The next morning I did just as I was commanded. Then the people asked me, \"Won't you tell us what these things you are doing mean for us?\" So I answered them, \"The word of the Lord came to me. Say to the house of Israel, this is what the Lord God says. I am about to desecrate my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your heart.\" Also, the sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword. Then you will do just I have done. You will not cover your mustache or eat the bread of mourers. Your turbans will remain on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not lament or weep but will waste away because of your iniquities and will groan to one another. Now Ezekiel will be left a sign will be left a sign for you. You will do everything that he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord God. As for you, son of man, know that on that day I will take from them strong from them their stronghold, their pride and joy, the delight of their eyes, and the longing of their hearts, as well as their sons and daughters. The Lord gives and the Lord takes away. &gt;&gt; You know, I I find this to be one of the hardest passages to wrestle with in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like God literally told Ezekiel, \"Hey, I'm going to take your wife from you.\" You know, we learned about the vision of a prophet, the message of a prophet, but right now we're getting into the life of a prophet, &gt;&gt; the testimony that he gives his preachers. You know, people ask, why do bad things happen to good people? But it's a wrong question because the Bible says no one is good. &gt;&gt; Right? I find the question that we really struggle with, especially as disciples, is why do bad things happen to God's people? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To those who actually are committed to obeying God. Like Ezekiel, one of the only righteous men left on planet Earth, still had his wife taken from him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's interesting, right? Because people talk about, you know, why do bad things happen to good people or God's people? And you know, one thing people say is, well, to understand, you know, the good, we have to understand the bad, right? &gt;&gt; But that's actually not what God is teaching Ezekiel right here. &gt;&gt; Because we, why did God really take away Ezekiel's wife? It wasn't to understand what is good or what is bad. It was to understand God. &gt;&gt; That you know, Ezekiel, I want you to feel what I feel, &gt;&gt; right? when my people just commit sin after sin and now they're being wiped out because of their sin that though they're being wiped out though I have to give them consequences you think this feels good you think I take pleasure in this like you think I I I enjoy this feeling that I'm laughing at this I hate this I hate this and you know what he literally says Ezekiel do you understand my pain now you know this quote by this famous author CS Lewis that pain insists upon being attended. Uh God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciousness, but shouts in our pains. &gt;&gt; It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world. And that's a great quote and I think it's powerful that God speaks the loudest to us through our pain. &gt;&gt; But let's go to Psalm 119. &gt;&gt; It's a good quote, but it's not scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; In verse 71 of Psalm 119, it says, \"It was good for me to be afflicted &gt;&gt; so that I could learn your statutes.\" &gt;&gt; Isn't that a powerful passage? &gt;&gt; Like looking at your affliction, looking at your pain, looking at what you suffered, your conclusion is it is good. &gt;&gt; The Lord gives and the Lord takes away. You know, I I think sometimes we hold on to sin and we have to let go of sin. Amen. Sin that we bring from our old life. But sometimes we're not holding on to sin. Sometimes we're holding on to pain. &gt;&gt; And we need to learn to hold on to God's word. &gt;&gt; We need to learn to not bring pain into our disciplehip. Carry it with us every step we go. Not bring sin into our disciplehip. Yes. The pain that we experience is now a testimony to help those around us. But we don't live according to that pain anymore. &gt;&gt; We live according to his statutes, &gt;&gt; according to his word. And I believe that when we can truly let go of sin, when we can truly repent of our sin, let go of all this pain, that we, like Ezekiel, will begin to understand God more and more. And of course, he literally sent down Jesus that we may understand him. So now we literally get to relate to Jesus being having all this pain inflicted upon us yet still doing what is right because of it. Hope you're encouraged by that passage. Let's go back to Ezekiel 26. &gt;&gt; Uh last and final point &gt;&gt; is uh God is real. I hope you believe that &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; God is real &gt;&gt; in chapters uh 25 to 28 uh God actually announces destruction on the neighboring nations right so you know he announced it to his children because of their sin but now he's like hey guess what actually you know I'm casting judgment on the neighbors as well right like it's kind of like you know you're you're messing around with your sibling and Maybe one knocks over a pot the, you know, your mom comes in, you know, give that spanking, you know, and then and you're like, \"Oh my goodness, like I'm so glad I did knock over the pot.\" And your mom's like, \"You're not safe, buddy.\" You know, it's like that that is basically what happens here, right? Um because why was God announcing judgment? And if you go through the uh the chapters 25- 28, it was because they persecuted Israel. Um you know it says in verse three they exclaimed aha that's it was aha you know thank goodness that the sanctuary was destroyed. In verse 6 it says they clapped their hands and stamped their feet and rejoiced when Israel uh was holding God in contempt. U it says that in verse 12 that they acted vengefully against the house of Judah um and took revenge on them. It says in verse uh 15 that they had perpetual hatred against Israel and God was like, \"Hey, yeah, they're being punished for their sins, but you're going to be punished for your persecution against my people.\" It's kind of crazy to think that even though like God is literally separating himself from his people, he is still in a sense acting for them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Say, \"Hey, like yes, I'm punishing you, but they're not free because of it. They're just as wrong. you know, um, in verse we're going to look at chapter 26. In chapter 26, chapter 27, most of chapter 28, um, it talks about one specific kingdom, which is Tyrie, right? And it's quite interesting in verse uh, 1 in chapter 26 says, \"In the 11th year on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, son of man, because Tyrie said about Jerusalem, aha, the gateway to the peoples is shattered. she has uh been turned over to me. I will uh be filled and now that she lie in ruins. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says. See, I am against you, Tyrie. I will raise up many nations against you just as the sea raises waves. So, literally at the lowest point of uh of where Israel is at spiritually, at the height of their destruction, there were nations rejoicing, &gt;&gt; happy that it was happening. And for any of you guys who know what happens in with persecution is they rejoice when of course sometimes we do do bad things, right? &gt;&gt; You know, because we're people, you know, the church is made of people and people are sinners. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the God, we are still seen as God's people. And just because we might do wrong from time to time, it doesn't give people the authority and it doesn't validate them persecuting us. Amen. God still enacts judgment. Let's go to Romans chapter 12. God never overlooks persecutors. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Romans chapter 12 in verse 17, it says, \"Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Give careful thought to do what is honorable in everyone's eyes. If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.\" Friends, do not avenge yourselves. Instead, leave room for God's wrath because it is written, \"Vengeance belongs to me. I will repay, says the Lord.\" But if your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him something to drink. For in so doing, you will be heaping fiery coals on his head. Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good. &gt;&gt; You know, I I find this passage really convicting. And the reality is there is no reason to react to persecution. You know, I find that when people react negatively and unspiritually to persecution is actually because they are doubtful &gt;&gt; and they are struggling. Someone who is secure and humble before the Lord, they look at persecution is, \"Oh, that's wrong. I don't even respond to allegations.\" Right? If someone comes up to me says, \"Malik, I don't understand like you are this crazy preacher and you're a white man.\" &gt;&gt; I wouldn't even respond. I'd be like, Oh, &gt;&gt; like the moment someone says something to you that's false, you don't give it any attention, right? Like that it has no sway on your mind. If you started talking to me about Malik, you're a wicked sinner. I'm like, I'm trying, you know, I really don't want to be. But if you called me something that I'm not, I wouldn't even be faced. &gt;&gt; I'd be like, what are you talking about? I wouldn't even react to it. You know, there's a time when I was uh studying the Bible with this young man and he texted me saying, \"Hey, I found all of this persecution about you guys in this church online.\" Hey, let's talk about it. I Let's talk about it. And probably for the first time ever, he said, \"Yes, okay. Most people don't want to talk about it.\" He said, \"Yes.\" &gt;&gt; So, we sat and we talked about it. We went one by one. Hey, you know, I saw that you separate people from their families. I'm like, \"That's not even true. Like, I one I hang out with my family every Sunday. I know this brother that you're also stud the Bible with. He hangs out with his family every Sunday. He also lives with his family. No one told him to move. No one told him to stop. So that's totally untrue. Um another time he said um uh he said specifically um I'm forgetting right now, but he was he was naming like allegation after allegation and rumor after rumor. And we went through every single one. I'm like, \"Hey, that's not true.\" you know, like uh at one point say, \"Yeah, but like you know, you guys tell people they can't like have their own form of entertainment. Like if I'm playing video games that you'll ask me to stop playing video games and come share my faith.\" I'm like, \"I play video games.\" &gt;&gt; A few a few months ago, I invited a bunch of single brothers over. That's like all we did, you know, and like I had the teens over as well a few weeks ago. Like we do that. And I was like, \"Well, like you could be a disciple and do those things.\" He's like, \"Well, what if I'm I'm like playing and you ask me to come share my faith?\" I'm like, \"Well, if you're already sharing your faith, why would I call you to stop doing what you're doing, you know, like you can do both, you know?\" And he's like, \"Well, but what if in the moment I don't want to share my faith? I want to play video games.\" I'm like, \"But if you're sharing your faith, I I wouldn't even ask you. I'm I'm I'm unsure like where this is really going.\" &gt;&gt; And he's like, \"Well, what if like I don't really share my faith, but I just really want to play video games.\" And yes, I would bring it up to you. You have to go share your faith, right? And like we went back and forth on the on this topic, right? And he's like, \"Well, like here's the thing. Like if I'm playing games, I don't want to be asked to stop.\" &gt;&gt; I'm like, \"Oh, &gt;&gt; I see the issue. &gt;&gt; You wanted to use all this persecution to validate how you idolize video games. I got it. &gt;&gt; It makes sense. And literally the persecution is a smoke screen for his own sin. &gt;&gt; And it happens constantly guys. Guys, we cannot be phased by persecution. &gt;&gt; There's always a root behind it. &gt;&gt; Always a root behind it. The amount of times people have talked about, well, your doctrine this, your doctrine that, and they leave, and then they have an immoral relationship. Like it happens so often. And but I think what we have to do as disciples, it says here to love them, &gt;&gt; to not view view them any differently than Jesus would, &gt;&gt; right? And it says by do that you heat burning coals on their head. You know, it won't injure them. It won't really harm them. Just like get it off. You know, it's like if someone's like, \"What are you doing? Like you're a terrible man and all you teach is false auction.\" Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, bro. Hey, you want to get some coffee? What the heck? You know, it's like like the way they react is like why you like can you just like fight me back? you know, like &gt;&gt; but we have to really not respond to persecution. Let's go back to Ezekiel 26. &gt;&gt; Uh we're going to, you know, see what happened uh to Tyrie. Amen. And I find this to be really cool. Like guys, this is about to be really cool. &gt;&gt; And I hope you're still with me here, &gt;&gt; you know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh chapter 26, uh it says in verse 32, we're talking about Tyrie a little bit. And this will be our last thing we'll talk about. In verse 32, it says uh in their wailing they lay meant for you, mourning over you, who was like Tyrie, silence in the middle of the sea. So Tyrie was an island and it was viewed as an impenetrable island because they had a fleet of ships all around it protecting it, right? Uh it says in verse 33, \"When your merchandise was unloaded from the seas, you satisfied many peoples. You enriched the kings of earth with your abundant wealth and goods. Now you are wrecked by the sea in the depths of the waters. Your goods and the people within you have gone down.\" The entirety of chapter 27 talks about how tyrie an island will sink to the bottom of the ocean and is literally saying, \"Hey, like you have this great island. you will no longer be an island and that will not be what you are anymore. And uh it's interesting uh can we show uh the first image on this um the one where it is it just says Tyrie and old Tyrie. &gt;&gt; Come on. [Music] &gt;&gt; There we go. Okay. So So this was Tyrie, right? this island, fleet of ships all around it, impenetrable, right? And Alexander the Great, he built this dam because of course he wanted to conquer Tyrie, right? But the point of it wasn't just to build this and cross over it. What happened was over the course of six to seven months, the current of the water let all this sand and debris build up and he literally instead of taking a boat to Tyrie, he had his whole army cross on dry lands. &gt;&gt; And so it it looks like a small line there, but that's what he built over time. Like you'll see the next image. Uh can we look at the next image of different uh of Tyrie just kind of throughout time? So it went from this, you know, he built the dam, but over time because of the currents of the water, it got smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, and finally that is Tyrie right now. &gt;&gt; Um, can we see a current image of Tyrie? Just the overview and satellite view. &gt;&gt; That's Ty now. &gt;&gt; Isn't that insane? Like it used to be this island, huge island surrounded by ships. &gt;&gt; That's what is now. &gt;&gt; God said that I will sink you to the ocean. Your glory will be no more. And this happened because Alexander the Great built a dam and the debris built up. So, but you know, this was written in 586 BC after the third siege, right? And Alexander didn't do this until 3:22 BC. So that means the Bible predicted this would happen 250 years before it happens. &gt;&gt; Isn't that insane? &gt;&gt; But when I looked that up, I was like, that's crazy. Like God is real. Is without a doubt God is real. In fact, it is so real that the Bible is so specific on what happens that many people have tried to reason with like how does the Bible know this? And people's conclusion is, well, maybe it was written after the fact. Because that is how accurate the Bible's prophecies are. &gt;&gt; That the conclusion is that God must be real. Let's close out in Ezekiel 28. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Nebby. Ezekiel 28 in verse 24 says, \"The house of Israel will no longer be hurt by prickly briars or painful thorns from all their neighbors who treat them with contempt. They will know that I am the Lord God. This is what the Lord God says. When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples uh where they were are scattered, I will demonstrate my holiness through them in the sight of the nations and they will live in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob. They will live securely, build houses and plant vineyards. They will live securely when I execute judgments against all their neighbors who treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God. You know, I hope you're encouraged really seeing how true God is. &gt;&gt; That that he predicts things that happen hundreds of years before they happen, before Alexander the Great was even a thought, right? And yet God is extremely real. He is real, right? And I hope you uh know that very well. And yet some people they not only reject God but they reject the life that they have to off he has to offer him a life of repentance a a life of letting go of pain. So I I hope that especially reading the scripture that after God does everything all this wrath upon the Israelites and all of Judah, he still has this plan and hope that they can live securely and not only away from sin, away from pain, but even away from persecution &gt;&gt; where the people that want to harm you are no more. You know, and I I think it's really powerful to think about that that, you know, even going through hard times, God still wants what is best for you. &gt;&gt; And that we can know that, you know what, I don't have to turn to sin. I don't have to hold on to pain. I can hold on to his word. Why? Because God is real. And I can let go of everything uh that I try to bring with me, even if it's from my old life or it's new sin regardless. Because no matter what happens, God gives and God takes away. And let's remember that. And to God be all the glory.",

    "summary": "Malik Speckman's sermon, \"The Lord Gives and He Takes Away,\" delves into Ezekiel to explain God's judgment on Israel and Judah for their spiritual promiscuity, represented by holding onto old sins (Egypt) and adopting new ones (Assyria/Babylon). He highlights God's immense patience but warns against misinterpreting it as tolerance, illustrating with parables of a corroded pot and Ezekiel's personal loss to convey God's pain over sin. The sermon also addresses God's judgment on persecuting nations like Tyre, urging disciples to respond to persecution not with retaliation, but by conquering evil with good, ultimately fostering a deeper understanding of God's character through suffering and obedience.",

God intended to use Israel for His glory, preparing a magnificent meal, but the pot (Israel) was so corrupted by bloodshed and unrepentant acts that its contents became useless.

    "transcript": "Today we'll be covering chapters 16 through 22. Um it's quite a bit of text, so we're not going to, of course, be able to read it all. I'm going to do my best uh to make sure we're out of here, you know, before dinner. Um &gt;&gt; this is my dinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, &gt;&gt; so just a little recap, you know, I actually really appre appreciate, um, the contribution. That was incredible. &gt;&gt; Uh, it's a future preacher right there. &gt;&gt; Um, but, uh, you know, it was an amazing passage because you see kind of that was the height of, uh, Israel's glory, uh, when they were doing their best, you know, spiritually and, uh, under the reign of King David. And it was a it was a great time. You know, God was happy. Uh God's people were happy. Uh we're were where, you know, the the the whole world knew about God through his people. &gt;&gt; Uh and it was a great time. Uh yet sadly, we see uh that after King David and and prior generations, uh they they began to falter uh to the point of no return. Uh and so you you know when you come upon the book of Ezekiel uh they you know of course were sent into Babylon uh the Babylonian kings came and took a portion of Israel and brought them to uh Babylon uh especially the king and and the leaders leaving Israel uh in ruins uh with with you know no hopes of you know coming back. Then God called Ezekiel to prophesy to his people. Uh to the the exiles that were there in Babylon. Um yet he let them know. He let Ezekiel know that they're not going to listen. &gt;&gt; Uh that's an incredible thing to think about. It's like would you would you talk to someone and give your whole heart to someone knowing ahead of time that they're not going to respond? &gt;&gt; It's a ch that challenges me, you know? Uh I want to try to outsmart, you know, when I'm sharing my faith. It's like I just want to find the open people. Uh but we can't do that. We don't know. Um and are you willing to talk to people even when they're not open? &gt;&gt; Um and so that was Ezekiel's task. Um and we see, you know, what what Malik has already covered and uh so many amazing visions and signs that God has given uh Ezekiel to give to the people to remind them of where they've come from and and how they got to where they are now. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Um, and you know, it's made me reflect as I've read through the history and read, you know, these chapters we're covering today. Uh, of course, I've had to just reflect and what does this mean for my life? &gt;&gt; Uh, and what does this mean for, you know, spiritual Israel today? Uh, for for his church, for his people on earth today. And, you know, for me, I was baptized 2007 in LA. Uh and at that time the only church in in the ICC in the movement was was there in LA. That was it. Uh and you know as I you know went through the Bible studies and I got to the counting the cost study. Uh you know Kit McKeen was there in my counting the cost study and and he actually gave me some really uh powerful words that I needed to hear to get me to a place of baptism. Um and so I say all that because I've I've grown up in the kingdom. Um, if it wasn't for the church, I I wouldn't have found my amazing wife. &gt;&gt; Uh, I wouldn't have my amazing family. I wouldn't be half or even any of the man that I am today have any of the convictions. Uh, and not be able I I I just I wouldn't any good thing I've ever gotten in my life prior to God, I destroyed. &gt;&gt; Uh, I didn't know how to, you know, just function as a human being. Um, and and all of it is is because of God, uh, and his church. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, I wouldn't have been able to travel the world and and see all the things I've been able to see. And, uh, I just I I love this church. Um, and you know, of course, the church is not without problems, &gt;&gt; just as you are not without problems. Um, &gt;&gt; there it is. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, and so it's it's it's important to reflect. Um and of course I've done some reflection even even what's happened in Israel where you know because of their sin God you know allowed and then not only allowed but in really the Bible says that God made it happen for the Babylonians to come and and you know send them into exile. That was God's plan. Um and and and foretold that it would happen if they didn't repent. Um and so this wasn't just some evil deed by the Babylonians. This was God's plan. But, you know, these things happen and and when you're in a moment, you're like, you're not really thinking like that. You're just like, this is a terrible situation. Um, and of course, when you know, we have people fall away or we have division within the church and, you know, mass amounts of people, you know, are divided, uh, it's a terrible thing. Uh, but it's important to reflect. &gt;&gt; It's important to look at, okay, what is how did we get to this point? What is our blame in it? What is my blame in it? And and what are the lessons? What is God trying to teach us? Um, and so that's the the heart and the spirit of this lesson today. Um, the the title of this lesson is standing in the gap. &gt;&gt; Standing in the gap. You know, I looked it up because I I have an idea of what it means. I was like, \"Okay, let me just ask like Chad GBT or something like &gt;&gt; what what does this mean?\" Uh, and so here's here's the response. Standing the gap means taking responsibility to protect, defend, or intercede for someone or something that is vulnerable or in a difficult situation. It often involves acting as a mediator or advocate, especially when others are unable to do so themselves. The phrase originates from the Bible where it describes the act of physically standing in the gap in a city's wall to prevent an enemy from entering in. &gt;&gt; Uh and so physically, you know, of course, Israel had borders uh and they were protected by a wall. uh and when enemies would invade or if the wall would been broken down, it was upon the the men to go and stand in the gap &gt;&gt; uh to protect the enemies from invading uh and this was war. Um and so that was that's the reference. And so, you know, of course, spiritually, you know, we can have gaps in our own character and our own hearts. We have to look and say, where are the the the gaps in my heart spiritually that I need to to deal with? Um, and so it is as a people, as a nation, as a church to look at and say, where are our gaps? Where are we vulnerable for attack? &gt;&gt; Um, and so, uh, I have three points. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And they're going to be the three, uh, you know, really it's it's what God shows through the scriptures. Uh, and I believe they are three ways where we need to stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; Uh, and some some holes in the wall that I want to be able to to, you know, stand in the gap and fight and defend. Uh so the first one is standing in the gap of holiness. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's point number one. Point number two is standing in the gap of character &gt;&gt; and point number three is standing in the gap of responsibility. &gt;&gt; Um and so I want to start in chapter 20 uh and then and then we're going to work backwards to 16. &gt;&gt; Uh so if you could turn to chapter uh 20. &gt;&gt; All right. Come on. And so in the beginning of this chapter, essentially what's happening is that there's some elders that come to Ezekiel uh to inquire of the Lord. Now, keep in mind, they're in they're in exile. They're in Babylon. And so, of course, I'm sure they're probably wanting to know like, \"Hey, God, when are we going to get out? You know, what's the plan? You know, this is not good. I don't like this. Can you please give us a prophecy of encouragement to let us know like, hey, you know, when when is this going to end?\" Wow. &gt;&gt; Um, and yet God's response uh is he told Ezekiel, \"Hey, tell them, you think I'm going to let you inquire of me? No, I'm not.\" &gt;&gt; Uh, because you refuse to deal with your sin. &gt;&gt; Uh, and I believe that that has a message for us as well. You know, we should not expect God to answer our prayers if we're not unwilling to change. &gt;&gt; Uh, you're speaking to a wall at that point, a wall of sin. Um, &gt;&gt; and so you deal with that. You know, as soon as your your heart is soft and you're willing to actually look in the mirror and change, &gt;&gt; then God's going to reveal some stuff to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Um, and so, you know, he he tells he he reminds them of, you know, their history. &gt;&gt; Um, and in verse eight, and what's cool, too, is that when he talks to the people, he talks to them as one. uh a lot of times he refers to just the city of Jerusalem uh or the people of Israel and and God judges them all as one and I think it's important for us because you know we are individual people and we do at the end of the day we are going to be judged as individual individual people &gt;&gt; uh and so we can't just follow the crowd but at the same time we are a family &gt;&gt; um and if we see something if we see an issue to just not say anything uh is is unrighteous and in fact you you are part of the Uh and so let's look at verse 8. Uh and again, this is the story of of what God is telling Ezekiel to tell the people of what happened. Verse 8 says, \"But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me. They did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in Egypt. But for the sake of my name, I did what would keep it from being profained in the eyes of the nations they live among, and who in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites by bringing them out of Egypt. Therefore, I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the desert. I gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws. For the man who obeys them will live by them. Also, I gave them my Sabbath as a sign between us so that they would know that I, the Lord, make them holy. Uh, and so God here is saying that like even when they were in Egypt, he's like, \"Okay, I want to do a great thing. I'm going to I'm going to bring you guys out of Egypt. Just get rid of the idols that the the Egyptians worship and just just worship me.\" Uh, but it says they rebelled. They didn't do it. And so, right away, God is just like, \"Forget it. I'm done.\" He he wanted to pour out his wrath. But it's interesting here in verse 9 why he didn't do it. Uh it doesn't say that he he he didn't do it for their sake. &gt;&gt; It actually says that he he relented for the sake of his own name &gt;&gt; that it wouldn't be profained by the other nations. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Uh and if we keep reading once they went into the desert they rebelled again. Uh and then he wanted to do the same thing and he's like you know forget it. I'm just gonna pour out my wrath on them. But in verse 14, he says the same thing. But for the sake of my name, I did what would keep it from being profained in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. And so we know we understand that everybody that left Egypt died in the desert except for two, Caleb and Joshua. Uh and and their their children, you know, were the ones that entered. And so God gave their children a second chance. But then in verse 21, it says, \"But the children rebelled.\" &gt;&gt; They did not follow my decrees. They were not careful to keep my laws. Although the man who obeys them will live by them, and they desecrated my Sabbath. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the desert. But I withheld my hand, and for the sake of my name, I did what would keep it from being profained in the eyes of the nation in whose sight I had brought them out. So, this is quite interesting. You would think that he would relent for their own sake, but that's not the case. And so, I had to really think about this. I'm like, what what is going on here? Um, and here's what I concluded. Um, ultimately, we understand that God knows what is best. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. And we don't. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we understand that God wants all people on earth to honor him and to rever him. Doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter where you come from. God loves all people and all people are his. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so God's plan wasn't like, well, let me just set apart these people because I love them more. That that's not what he was doing here. What he did is like, let me set apart these people. Let me give them my decrees. let me give them my laws as an example for the world so that once the world sees just like when King David reigns what a a nation that follows God that honors God that has no other gods they will say wow that is amazing that is a nation that follows God I should probably get rid of my idols too I want to serve that God that's what's real but the Israelites failed in doing this and so God said he relented not for their sake they deserve the punish punishment, &gt;&gt; but it's like but it's for the other nations. I I want them to have an example to follow. And so maybe they'll repent and be able to be that example. And he gave him chance after chance after chance. &gt;&gt; And so what we find is that that's God's heart is that God wants all people to be saved. And we understand this. And so, you know, there's a passage in First Peter, &gt;&gt; uh, chapter 2, verse 21, &gt;&gt; and it says, \"To this you were called because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps.\" &gt;&gt; Uh, and so, you know, honestly, I I I got a little emotional when that song was being sang of I could have called 10,000 angels. Um, I hadn't heard that in quite a while. But it was just, of course, I'm thinking about this lesson and I think about, you know, Jesus's example and he could have done that, rightly so. He could have ended it. But it says that God, you know, ultimately the Israelites failed to be what God had hoped, failed to be an example to the world. So, he had to send a son. &gt;&gt; And of course, Jesus fulfilled that role. &gt;&gt; And he did that. Uh, a and when the Israelites gave up when it was tough and gave into sin, Jesus did not. &gt;&gt; Um, and Jesus would have been right in doing so. The Israelites were never right in their rebellion. &gt;&gt; Um, and so what's cool now today is no matter where you come from, no matter, you know, what you believe, you know, in your past, you can look to Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's the example. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you could imitate Jesus. Come on. &gt;&gt; And you could then come into a saving covenant relationship with him because of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Uh and and and it's what it's what the Israelites were supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Um but today, this is what we have. We have Jesus. Uh and so for us as disciples, this is what we're striving to be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh we are striving to imitate Jesus. And God has chosen us and set us apart to be holy. Not because you're special in any sort of way. It's so that you can be a light to the others. &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, I really appreciate Fernando just talking to him. &gt;&gt; Um, but you know, just hearing his testimony, you know, he was reached out to by some brothers on campus and you know, of course it's skeptical. It's like, ah, I already go to church. I already know. But, but when you see, okay, this is different. This is not just another Bible study. This is just not another church. But there's something different. That's the only thing that would allow this situation to happen today where he's going to repent of all his sins and get baptized. &gt;&gt; And this is what we're all about. This is why we have come together and this is what Christianity is all about. &gt;&gt; Uh and so we have to be careful to not, you know, be so confident that God has chosen you just because you're special. &gt;&gt; But understand God has chosen you and each one of us are special to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he's chosen you. so that you can live a life that is matching the Bible and for those that actually want to see God can have somewhere to look and see like that's real. That's that's what I want to do right there. &gt;&gt; Um and so point number one, &gt;&gt; standing in the gap of holiness. We're going to go back to Ezekiel 16. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, uh I'm not going to read the whole chapter. It's quite long. &gt;&gt; We got you, bro. It's also quite graphic. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, there's themes of, you know, unwanted children being left to die. &gt;&gt; Um, there's themes of prostitution, of, you know, gross gross prostitution. Um, there's, you know, there's a lot. And so, you know, I I encourage you to to to read it because it it helps you to understand what's what's going on in the world because there's nothing in in the scripture that isn't going on today. &gt;&gt; True. Very true. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, people are still killing children. Uh, they just do it in the womb. &gt;&gt; Uh, and and if you understand why they were doing it back then, it was the same reasons. They just it was unw unwanted children. Maybe I wanted a boy, but I got a girl. Or maybe it was, you know, deformed in some way. It's like, oh, I'll just leave on the field. Uh I bet you, you know, if they had the medical medical advancements today, they would, you know, do what we're doing, what what people are doing. &gt;&gt; Uh and it's an evil practice. &gt;&gt; Um so let's read chapter 16 starting in verse one. &gt;&gt; So this just so you know, this is a story, okay? This is a parable. Um and in verse one, it says, \"The word of the Lord said to me, son of man, confront Jerusalem with her evil practices.\" And so this is the purpose of this story uh is to confront Jerusalem as one um and to help them to see where they are and where they've come from. Verse three, it says, \"And say this is what the sovereign Lord says to Jerusalem.\" Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites. Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. On the day you were born, your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths. No one looked on you with pity, and no one had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field. On the day you were born, you were despised. Uh, and so this is a very sad imagery, but again, this is not a story or or or imagery that was foreign to the people. This was common practice. And so they understood what God was talking about. Um, and they're saying that that you were that unwanted child that was left to die, talking to Jerusalem. And so, of course, what he's referring to is when they enter the land of Canaan, uh, it was the Amorites and the Hittites that, you know, a majority of the land was ruled by. And, you know, they entered the land that God promised and and they're still there, you know, uh, and they had to contend with with with those people. Um, and they were unwanted. &gt;&gt; Um, and that was that was Israel's beginning. That was Jerusalem's beginning. Um and then in verse six it says then I passed by and of course this is still in you know parable form. I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood. As you lay there in your blood I said to you live. I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of jewels. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew and you were naked and bare. Later I looked by and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the sovereign Lord, and you became mine. I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with a garments. I adorned you with jewelry. I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck. I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. So you were adorned with gold and silver. Your clothes were a fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was fine flower, honey, and olive oil. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen. and your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect declares the Lord. Uh and I just love you know the end of the story here. Uh it's quite beautiful and we see that God had compassion uh on this dying child um and commanded it to live uh and God says that he he made her grow up and become beautiful. &gt;&gt; Uh and then when she was old enough entered into a marriage covenant with her uh and she became mine. Uh and then he says he bathed her with water and gave her many uh beautiful things uh and and she became famous and prosperous in all the land. And I can't help but think about what modern day conversion really is is spiritually. &gt;&gt; You know, I think about a good parallel passage in the New Testament would be the the Good Samaritan. uh where the man is left beaten on the side of the road and a and a Samaritan, you know, picks him up and it's very controversial because the Jew and the religious leaders pass by and don't do anything. But then the Samaritan, you know, picks up the man, washes his wounds, brings him to the end. Uh and of course, what is what is the symbolism here? You know, I know for me, uh when I before I became a disciple, that was my life. I was uh kicking in my own blood, just basically waiting to die. Uh I had no hope. I was literally nothing good in my life uh worth talking about. Um and and that was it. And any even if I did somehow develop some character and and make some money or do some good stuff, like I was just totally a selfish person that had no idea how to, you know, care for anybody else but myself. Um and uh and yet God had compassion on me, saw me where in my state um and and commanded me to live um and took care of me and taught me how to grow. Uh and I love this, you know, even in this marriage covenant where God, you know, uh you know, makes this covenant and declares that you are mine. Of course, this this is the covenant that uh we enter at baptism. Uh and and then even in verse n, I bathe you with water. And &gt;&gt; it's right there. &gt;&gt; Uh and it's amazing because this is this is what anybody that's been made into a disciple has experienced. Uh and this is what Israel experienced. Uh and it's an amazing thing and it's great and it should be celebrated. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But there's a warning as well. In verse 15, &gt;&gt; it says, \"But you trusted in your beauty, and you used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by, and your beauty became his. You took some of your garments and made godly high places where you carried your carried on your prostitution. Such things should never happen, nor should they ever occur.\" And he goes on and on and on. I mean, it's if you if you continue to read, uh there's there's gross acts that are committed. Um they they see these other nations around them, Babylon, Sodom, Egypt, and just prostitute themselves to them. Just imitate whatever they're doing. Um and and God is is is angry and rightfully so. You know, I can I I literally can only imagine I you know what that would be like, you know, for your wife to just, you know, uh be unfaithful but like unashamed and just keep doing it and not really care. Uh I I can't even imagine the anguish and pain and anger that that that would cause. Uh and this is what God felt. This is the anger and the pain that that God endured. Um, and you know, for me, I I think about how it can become easy once once you know, you've you've become a disciple and been forgiven of your sins and then God starts to kind of bless your life. Uh maybe you get a wife, maybe you get a husband, uh you start dating, you get you know you advance in your career, you start growing some character, you know, you start learn oh I know how to behave. I know how to like you know make friends. I know how to you know I I didn't know how to there's so many things I didn't even know how to just operate in the world prior to become a disciple and God has taught me so much. &gt;&gt; Um but what happens is when you stop remembering God and you think like oh I I got all this because of my own wisdom, my own effort. uh it was my own strength that got me to where I am. &gt;&gt; Uh well then you you're going to fall right into the same trap. &gt;&gt; Uh you will inevitably prostitute yourself to the world. &gt;&gt; Uh and and maybe you'll be good at hiding it. &gt;&gt; Uh maybe, you know, the Bible talks about how we can have whitewash walls. &gt;&gt; Uh where we just try to make it look really good, but deep down it's rotten to the core. Um, and it stems from forgetting God, forgetting where you came from. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Forgetting the the the, you know, your life and your your mind and your heart. Uh, and and just your your sin ultimately, &gt;&gt; forgetting your sin and who you are without God. &gt;&gt; Um, and you know, this is a warning. &gt;&gt; This is a warning to not forget God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. My vow. Um, you know, let's skip over to verse 44. &gt;&gt; Verse 44, it says again, this is the same thing. This is God trying to just convince his people to repent. Says, \"Everyone who quotes Proverbs will quote this proverb about you. Like mother, like daughter. You are a true daughter of your mother who despised her husband and her children. And you are a true sister of your sisters who despised her husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hitittite. Your father an Amorite. Your old your older sister as uh Samaria who lived in the north of you with her daughters. And your younger sister who lived in the south of you with her daughters was Sodom. You not only walked in their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they. As surely as I live, declares the sovereign Lord. Your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done. Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom. She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed, and unconcerned. They did not help the poor and the needy. They were hotty and did detestable things before me. Therefore, I did away with them as you have seen. Samaria did not commit half of the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than than they and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done. &gt;&gt; And I mean, again, I I I would love to just continue reading the whole thing, but for the sake of time, I'm going to stop right there. It's it's really powerful. And and you know this this is an interesting part where he starts with this proverb. You are a true daughter of your of your mother who despised her husband and her children. You know um one of the things I find and and I I'll just share even from my life personally um that my my parents split up when I was pretty young uh and then I ended up growing up with my mom and my three sisters. Um, and you know, because of my mother's hatred for for my dad, um, she poisoned me and my sister to to hate him as well. Um, and you know, really did damage. Um, and of course her heart, you know, I I I love my mom to death. We talk all the time and, you know, but but and she even recognizes, you know, her own mistakes in this, but I say this because it's very common. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's very common for for mothers to despise their husbands. Um, and in doing so, whether you're intentional or not, you then despise your children in the process. &gt;&gt; Um, it's important, you know, this is this is how God designed it to be, that that mothers and fathers are on the same page, that they get along, &gt;&gt; um, and that we fight for that. That that mothers should should support their husbands uh in what they do even when they don't agree. Why? Well, because the men are are called to support God. And what he decides, even if they don't, it's like the same relationship. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? Like, no one's exempt from this dynamic. &gt;&gt; But, but when when the women don't support and and you know, and rebel, uh, it only causes harm and damage. &gt;&gt; Um, and so I just want to say that because &gt;&gt; it's not an easy job. I love tell you that's not easy job to be to be a husband to be a father to to have to you know for all decisions you have to make the decisions and guess what most of my decisions aren't that great &gt;&gt; but but my wife follows anyways &gt;&gt; and that's how it's supposed to be a little side note right there but &gt;&gt; thank you &gt;&gt; amen but what's he really saying here what's what's the point of this of this story you know it's interesting because he refers to Sodom uh and these other evil nations as Israel's sister. And so in my initial reading, I was like, \"Oh, this must be like a translation issue.\" Uh uh they were set apart, like they're not of the same people. Um but I looked it up and it literally said, uh sister quotes same father. Oh, okay. And so what's what is he saying here? Uh he's saying that that you you you know, you think you're so much better. Wow. &gt;&gt; Actually, if you look at um verse 56, &gt;&gt; God says, \"You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride before your wickedness was uncovered.\" &gt;&gt; Uh and so this is the part the point is that that we understand that God loves all people and all people are his. And yet because they had been set apart, they viewed themselves as so much better &gt;&gt; just because even though they're doing more detestable practices. &gt;&gt; Um and so what you find is that being holy uh is it doesn't mean that you're you're chosen by God. That's not what being holy means. &gt;&gt; Uh being holy means you live the life that God called you to live. &gt;&gt; That's being holy. Um and so God calls you and sets you apart so that you can live that life. But what happened was the Israelites wanted the status of being God's people. They wanted the the privileges and the benefits that come with being under that covenant. Uh they wanted him to be their savior but not their lord. &gt;&gt; Uh and what you'll find is this is this this happens today. &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. you know, and we have to be careful for this uh in our own hearts is we can't, you know, just want to have the the the privilege and the benefits of being in this relationship with God. You know, one of the things that that does set us apart and I'm really grateful for is that we understand salvation doctrine. &gt;&gt; But we understand that that in order to be saved, you you have to have life and doctrine. &gt;&gt; And so if the only thing that sets us apart is our doctrine, then we failed. How's your life? &gt;&gt; You know, this is I believe the year of righteousness. &gt;&gt; And I think it's a good it's a good stance to take for the movement. You know, it comes from the passage in in Matthew 6 where it says, \"Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, but there's a realization we've been focusing just on the kingdom, but not really on the righteousness.\" &gt;&gt; And this is what happened here in with Israel. Um and so my my my call for this point guys uh is to have your life and doctrine is to look at your life to stand in the gap of holiness because holiness is how you live your life. &gt;&gt; Uh we are set apart because God has revealed to us his truth and that's amazing and that's a blessing and I'm really grateful for that. There is a lost world that needs us but if we don't live our lives according to the Bible it will be for nothing. People will come in, maybe learn the truth, &gt;&gt; but then see our example. &gt;&gt; And and they're not going to stay. &gt;&gt; Uh and so you guys feel good about standing in the gap of holiness. [Music] &gt;&gt; As a as a movement, as a church, as a people, let us stand in the gap of holiness. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Point number two, &gt;&gt; bro. &gt;&gt; Standing in the gap of character. &gt;&gt; Uh so we're going to read chapter 17. Right. &gt;&gt; Uh, and so, you know, this is an interesting story and and I had to really do a little bit of digging to figure it out and I'm going to do my best to, you know, really get through this briefly and explain it. &gt;&gt; Uh, but again, this is God using a story or an analogy to try to help the people understand what's going on. Um, and so essentially, let me just tell you what the story is. Uh the story is that there's a great eagle that that flies and and picks uh a branch from a cedar and plants it in a land of merchants by the water. And it says that the branches begin to grow and and you know have leaves and and flourish as they're pointing towards that great eagle. Uh and actually my wife helped me understand a little bit of what that means. But you know plants you know we have plants in our home. My wife also has a green thumb and uh you know they they they're searching for sun and so if the sun is like on the east they're going to like point in that direction to find it get get nutrients which was kind of cool. Um but this is what was happening is that um in this story that the plant was facing the eagle that had picked that plucked it. Um and then another great eagle came by and it says the plant started to point towards that eagle and so okay that's a story like well what does that mean? like what? Uh and then and then and then God says like &gt;&gt; uh &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, I'm going explain it. Well, God explains that. I'm not going to explain it. &gt;&gt; Um but but then God took, you know, is angry about this for some reason &gt;&gt; and he's like, \"Well, I'm going to just uproot you and and you know, the wind is going to blow and you're going to die.\" And I was like, \"What's going on here?\" Uh well, let's let's let's figure out what's going on, right? Um, let's read in verse 11. This is God explaining what's what's going on. &gt;&gt; In chapter 17, verse 11, it says, \"Then the word of the Lord came to me, say to this rebellious house, do you not know what these things mean? Say to them, &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; Say to them, \"The king of Babylon went to Jerusalem, carried off her king and her nobles, bringing them back to him to Babylon.\" Then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him under oath, putting him under oath. He also carried away the leading men of the land so the kingdom would be brought low, unable to rise again, surviving only by keeping his treaty. But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the treaty and yet escape? Uh and then God goes on to say, \"No, that's not going to happen. I'm not going to let that happen.\" So again, you have to figure out like why is God so upset here? They're in Babylon. They're in slavery. You know, they're they're oppressed. And it says when when they went when the Babylonians went to Israel, they grabbed the king and all the leaders uh so that Israel would be left desolate. Um and then the king, you know, of Israel made a treaty with the king of Babylonia in order to maintain peace uh even though they were enslaved. But so the king made this this uh vow, but then went behind his back, sent people to Egypt to say, \"Hey, can you come fight for us so we can free ourselves?\" And so, you know, you're like, \"Well, do you think God would want that?\" Well, what they failed to understand was that this was God's plan all along. &gt;&gt; Them being in Babylon wasn't, you know, some injustice. It was justice, actually. &gt;&gt; Uh it was the discipline that God had brought upon them, &gt;&gt; and they were trying to get out of it. And so what what's the lesson here? You know, I think that uh one passage I love in the Bible is where, you know, God God tells us to rejoice in suffering. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's kind of a hard passage to read. It's like, how do you do that? I don't feel happy when I'm suffering. You know, there was a fake it. Um but what what you find is that it says you rejoice in your suffering because you understand that suffering produces perseverance. perseverance, character, and character hope. &gt;&gt; So, you're not just like happy about the suffering, but you understand this is an opportunity to grow in my character. &gt;&gt; Uh, and so this is what the people failed to understand was that if they in the story, it says that that they were planted by the water there in Babylon and they were they were growing. They were actually uh good was coming. They they were being fruitful. Um, but but they stopped that process. They looked they got source from something else or, you know, nutrients from something else. And God was like, \"No, I'm pulling it out. That's not okay.\" You know, I think a good analogy would be like, um, if I'm disciplining my children and I tell my daughter, it's like, \"Okay, no more screen for a week.\" Instead, you know, you're going to you're going to uh, you know, do a book report. You know, I want you to, you know, how how bad. That's terrible that would be, right? Um, that shouldn't be a punishment. It should probably just be how how we live. So anyways, um but if I if I implemented this judgment on my daughter, uh and then when I'm at work, she goes to my wife and it's like, \"Do I really have to do this? Come on. Like this is too much. Just give me some grace. Come on.\" &gt;&gt; And then I come home and &gt;&gt; she's there on the screen. &gt;&gt; Or am I going to be like, \"Ah, well, you know, I guess it is what it is.\" Not if you're a good parent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And this so this is what this is what was going on right here &gt;&gt; with Israel. And so how does this relate to us, right? Uh well, we all endure discipline. The Bible says that we should uh understand that God is disciplining us as children &gt;&gt; when we endure when we go through discipline. And so we can either you know we have multiple ways to react to that discipline. We have multiple ways to respond to adversity in our lives. uh one option is to uh try to get out of it &gt;&gt; you know uh and and you know here's the thing too is that God used Babylon to implement this discipline God will use people in your life maybe a boss &gt;&gt; you know uh maybe maybe a spouse uh or maybe a really difficult situation difficult neighbor whatever uh God will use people in your life and situations &gt;&gt; to enact his discipline &gt;&gt; um And you know, Sam and I have definitely been through uh that many times. And in the moment, you're not like, \"Oh, this is definitely God's got discipline.\" We're just like, \"What the heck is going on?\" &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; This is injustice. God, take this away. And then he doesn't take it away. And then you have to start to think like, \"Ah, hm. Maybe this is God.\" And so, so the right way to respond is is you understand, okay, what's the lesson? &gt;&gt; Most of the trials you go through, I hate to tell you, but you brought it upon yourself. Um, &gt;&gt; and so it's pretty easy. It should be pretty easy to just like like recognize, yeah, &gt;&gt; I did this to myself. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; But even when that's not the case, even if you literally did nothing wrong, you know, uh you just you just move somewhere and your neighbor happens to be, you know, whatever, you know, I'm just speaking from example. &gt;&gt; Um it's like, okay, this is God's discipline. There's a lesson here. Um that's the right way to respond. You know, I was I was thinking about um you know, I was doing a little bit of research on like what it takes to be a Navy Seal. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not trying to do that, by the way. &gt;&gt; Oh, man. &gt;&gt; But, um it's it's cool because, you know, it is a rigorous process. Um and I I can't even begin to really comprehend it. Um, the point is that, you know, the process of training to become a Navy Seal isn't to like necessarily even find out who has the character to do it. I mean, it is, but that's not really it's not like a test. Uh, an evaluation, meaning it's not an evaluation of where you're at right now. &gt;&gt; Instead, it's it's a a practice. It's endurance. It's pain. It's trial to give you the character you need to be a Navy Seal. &gt;&gt; You get what I'm saying? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um and so they're not just trying to find who already has this character &gt;&gt; because pretty probably nobody really. Um but it's instead it's like, you know, some of the training they do seminar watching a little bit yesterday is uh things that make you panic, you know, like they'll they'll put you in a mask and fill it with water and shoot, you know, water inside and so it feels like you're drowning and you just have to sit there and be calm and not not freak out. And not everybody can do it. &gt;&gt; Okay? you know, they'll they'll tie your hands behind your back, put a weight on your feet, and put you in the water. &gt;&gt; You know, it's like things that I'd probably panic. &gt;&gt; But if you can be calm in those moments, if you can train yourself, endure the hardship, continue, you fail, you do it again, you do it again, you do it again, &gt;&gt; and be calm in these moments, well then by the end of that process, guess what? You've gotten character. Um and and one of the things also I love about character uh when you look at the specific qualities you know like fruits of the spirit uh you know there's dokime which is you know what is character uh defined as you know there's different qualities that you find and I I remember when I first realized that these qualities are nouns not verbs and and I like that because I was like okay how do I act uh patient how do I act loving and kind Um but it's it's not a verb it's not something that you could just act. Uh it's a noun. It's something you possess. &gt;&gt; And the only way that you can develop character is by persevering through trial. That's it. There's no other way. &gt;&gt; You can act it and maybe fool some people, but it ain't character. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh and so we as a church need to stand in the gap of character. That we need to be men and women that are willing to persevere through the trial. That we don't look for a way out. that we don't make excuses for our own behavior or our own situations. That we're not trying to blame other situations or or just get get out of the the the the pain that we're going through, &gt;&gt; but that we endure and we we suffer &gt;&gt; and be we rejoice in it. &gt;&gt; Not because it feels good, but because we know like thank you God for this opportunity to to to give me character. &gt;&gt; That's right. And we're looking forward to that character because ultimately here's the fact. &gt;&gt; Everybody in their life spiritually is either dying or they're growing. There's nothing else. &gt;&gt; And so if you're not growing in your character, guess what? You're dying. &gt;&gt; And and the hope that we have is hope and eternal life. &gt;&gt; And you cannot get there without growing in your character. It ain't going to happen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't be stagnant in your relationship with God. you will die. &gt;&gt; Uh and so that's my my challenge for you guys is to just look at the trials in your life and look at it with a different lens. You know, look forward be willing like volunteer yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For suffering, &gt;&gt; uh have that ma mindset and attitude. Doesn't mean like you just go like get into a car wreck just because &gt;&gt; invite it into your life when it comes. Don't don't run away from it. &gt;&gt; Come on. All right, my third and final point. &gt;&gt; Standing in the gap of responsibility. &gt;&gt; Um, we're going to read chapter 18 says, \"This is the word of the Lord uh that came to me.\" Chapter 18. Yes. &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord came to me. What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel? The fathers eat sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge. &gt;&gt; I surely as I live, declares the sovereign Lord, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel. For every living soul belongs to me. The father as well as the son. Both alike belong to me. The soul who sins is the one who will die. &gt;&gt; Um and then he goes on to talk about a righteous man. Suppose it's the story again. like suppose there's a righteous man who follows all my decrees, all my laws. Uh he's like that person will live. And then he says, well suppose he has a son and this son disobys everything and is violent and and ruthless. Well then that that that son will die. And then he says, but suppose that evil son has a son and that son sees the ways that his father was evil and says, I'm not going to do that and I'm going to be righteous. He says, \"Well, well, that's how I'm going to live.\" Seems pretty simple, right? That's how it should be. &gt;&gt; But the people were not happy about this. In verse 19, uh he says, \"Yet you ask, why does the son not share in the guilt of his father?\" It's like, what are you guys thinking? &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, \"Well, let me give you another example.\" And he says, \"Suppose there's a wicked man uh and then at some point in his life he he he repents &gt;&gt; and he changes. &gt;&gt; Well, guess what? He'll live. &gt;&gt; And let's say there's a a righteous man that begins to do evil and wicked. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Well, guess what? He will die. &gt;&gt; And again, they're angry. And it says in verse 25, &gt;&gt; yet you say, \"The way of the Lord is not just &gt;&gt; here.\" O Israel, oh house of Israel, is my way unjust. &gt;&gt; Is it not your ways that are unjust? &gt;&gt; If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and continues to sin, he will die. &gt;&gt; Because of a sin he has committed, he will die. But if a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and he does what is just and right, he will save his life. &gt;&gt; And so again, we have to figure out, okay, what's going on here? Like why are they so upset here? Well, the truth is that um they they wanted an excuse. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So one excuse was well, you know, my parents you were evil and wicked. I I had no chance. Uh it's I mean you know this is the proverb right? Your father eats sour grapes and your children's teeth you know are pucker your mouth puckers. It's like which is obviously that doesn't this can't physically happen. Um but but this was their theory this this uh amazing proverb. Uh and God's like you're not going to say that anymore. &gt;&gt; And he's like you are responsible. There's there's nobody else responsible for your life. And then he says, why why were they upset about this idea of a wicked person changing and them being saved and a a righteous person, you know, becoming evil and them being killed? Because, well, they were once a righteous people. &gt;&gt; Um, and and they wanted to kind of be accredited for their past righteousness. &gt;&gt; Uh, and they didn't want these wicked people, Sodom and these evil, you know, evildoers to have the opportunity to repent. &gt;&gt; You know, you'll find this even in the book of Jonah. uh he would he was upset that they repented. It's like what are you thinking? &gt;&gt; Well, it's it's it's from a heart of arrogance. &gt;&gt; It's when you again you you you want to just uh hang your hat on, you know, your past accomplishments or just &gt;&gt; that that you know the right doctrine. &gt;&gt; Um when when your life is in shambles. &gt;&gt; Come on. Um, but you know what's so amazing about this is that God ha has like God's law um is is equal for all people. &gt;&gt; Um there there is no favoritism whatsoever. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Um and and this should be encouraging. It's encouraging to the people that want to do good. &gt;&gt; Uh it's encouraging to people that that want to be righteous and not make excuses. &gt;&gt; Um but for the people that want to make excuses, um this is a hard lesson. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um and and and we have to stand in the gap of responsibility. Uh we can no longer you know make excuses. I think you know I heard it said recently like people go through life uh you know collecting excuses and putting them there put them in in their pockets. &gt;&gt; Uh you know &gt;&gt; and then and then when a situation comes about like they'll pull out the right excuse &gt;&gt; and they just have them lined up in their heads. &gt;&gt; Maybe you can relate. &gt;&gt; Um And so my challenge is this. &gt;&gt; Consider your excuses. &gt;&gt; Consider whether you say them out loud or they're just in your head. Consider them. And make a decision that you're you're going to throw them away. &gt;&gt; Make a decision to no longer make excuses for for your and some of it may be legit. You know, like I said, I'll just share with you as well. You know, I already did that my parents split up and I grew up with my mom and my three sisters. Um, you know, Thank you. Bless you. Uh, you know, I think, um, I remember, you know, in Halloweens, they would, uh, you know, paint my nails and I'd wear a dress. Uh, and I was a kid. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, if that happened today, uh, I didn't want to go there. You know, I would be convinced that I was I was somehow a girl now. Um, but that wasn't at the time happening, so thankfully. Um, but but the point I'm making is that um, I developed a lot of feminine qualities. Um, and um, and it doesn't necessarily mean it's evil, but I realized, you know, even recently that um, I need to change. Like I need to be a man. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; why? Because what God called me to be. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; and and you know, if if there's something off in my life, then there's no excuse. Yeah, it's true. Like it is true. Like ideally my dad would have stayed in in in my wife, you know, in my mother's life and he would have raised me to be a man. That that's ideal. But it didn't happen. Um and I never had that role model. But it's not an excuse. I got to figure it out. &gt;&gt; Um and so we all can have excuses. &gt;&gt; Um but but the my my encouragement is to throw away those excuses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's conclude in chapter 22. Chapter 22, uh, verse 26 says, \"Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things. They do not distinguish between holy and the common. They teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean. They shut their eyes and to to the keeping of my Sabbath so that I am profaneed among them. Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey. They shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain. her prophets whitewashed these deeds for they uh for them by false visions lying saying this is what the sovereign Lord says when that is not what the sovereign Lord says &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; the people of the land practice extortion commit robbery they oppress the poor and the needy and mistreat the alien denying them justice I look for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf the land so I would not have to destroy it. But I found none. So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the sovereign Lord. You know this is pretty intense. Of course we understand that God gave them multiple multiple chances. And even in this last chance, God knew they wouldn't change. And so it's for us. It says they didn't distinguish between the holy and the common. Um, you know, I think it's important for us today. You know, we look out into the world. And, um, there's a lot there's a lot going on &gt;&gt; and I think, um, you know, the Bible says to avoid all extremes. &gt;&gt; Well, what I find is that we like extremes. &gt;&gt; Uh, we love it. It's like there's a magnet on each side of us, you know, and and it's just like if we don't if we don't if we let if we let go, we'll just get sucked in. um you know and and definitely not political or I want to be political but I think that there are issues that are uh an issue of morality &gt;&gt; um that become politicized and once that happens it becomes taboo to talk about &gt;&gt; and it's a way for Satan to silence you know these issues that should should be talked about &gt;&gt; um and so you know my encouragement the Bible says that we are not aware of Satan's schemes Right. &gt;&gt; Uh we need to be educated. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We need to understand like what's going on in the world. We need to be able to look &gt;&gt; in a spiritual lens and understand that um God loves all people, &gt;&gt; but this is a battle of of good and evil. This is a spiritual battle that's happening. &gt;&gt; Um you know, I really care about what my my kids are being taught, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Um you know, I really care about the books that they're reading, the things that they're watching. uh we have to be very careful &gt;&gt; um because Satan is at work. &gt;&gt; Um and so I just want to encourage us to to not be unaware um to understand like the world is trying to teach us the things that are bad are good &gt;&gt; and the things that are good are bad &gt;&gt; and if we don't if we're not educated we're we you know lie susceptible of of falling into these things and and uh we don't we don't need to be extreme. We don't just like, oh, I'm pro this or I'm against this and just like, but we need we need balance. We need to to be able to look through and see things spiritually and what's going on. What's the real what's really happening here? &gt;&gt; Don't just take it at face value. &gt;&gt; Um, and you know, it says that that the prophets whitewashed their deeds um and and tried to proclaim like this is what God's saying when God's not really saying it. You know, we we we should want people in our lives that are going to tell us the truth. &gt;&gt; Um, not allow us to make excuses. If if you're if you're if the person that you're talking to the most is just validating all your feelings &gt;&gt; and making you feel good about all your sin. &gt;&gt; That's not something that's whitewash. &gt;&gt; Uh you want people that are going to tell you the truth, that are going to lay it out in love because they care about you. &gt;&gt; That those are the people you want to to influence you in your life. Um and then it says, \"I look for a man.\" Now, if you have the 2011, it might say, \"I look for someone.\" or even the NLC it says look for someone. But I looked this up &gt;&gt; and the Bible doesn't say someone, &gt;&gt; it says a man. &gt;&gt; And you know in the world today um the world wants of course all people are equal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Definitely. But uh not the same. Um and and the world wants roles to be interchangeable. But that's not how God designed it. God designed a man and designed a woman. &gt;&gt; And a man means to leave. Sorry, a man. &gt;&gt; Sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was a the spirit right there. &gt;&gt; A man needs to lead. &gt;&gt; Now again, someone pointed out I would have not noticed this if this wasn't pointed out. I just want to say take it for what you want. But we got all the women in the front and all the men in the back. &gt;&gt; I didn't even notice that. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; okay. We got a we got a couple men in the front. Amen. We give credit. &gt;&gt; But the men didn't be out front leading the way. &gt;&gt; It's the men that stand in the gap. And guess what? Women want to follow a man that leads. &gt;&gt; And so my call for us today uh is is to to be the men and the women that that care about honoring God's name. that collectively that we we should live such holy lives &gt;&gt; that when people see us, when they see us together, when they see us alone at work, wherever we are, they look it's like that is what I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; That is someone that is a group of people that is honoring God. I want that. And when we do that, &gt;&gt; we will be spiritual Israel &gt;&gt; as God intended. &gt;&gt; I love you. To God be the glory.",

        "insight": "These verses illustrate Israel's persistent rebellion, even from their time in Egypt and through generations in the desert, by refusing to give up idols. The speaker emphasizes that God repeatedly withheld His wrath and punishment, not for Israel's sake, but for the preservation and honor of His own name among the nations, demonstrating His desire for Israel to be a holy example to the world."

        "verse": "Ezekiel 16:1-15",
        "insight": "This passage describes God finding Jerusalem as an abandoned, unwanted child, rescuing, cleansing, and adorning her, and making a covenant. However, verse 15 serves as a warning, showing how Israel, once blessed, trusted in her own beauty and fame, 'prostituting' herself to other nations and forgetting God's grace."

    "transcript": "read uh chapters one and two and the the title for that lesson was called we will prophesy. We looked at how Ezekiel was given a vision from God and it allowed him to preach the message from God. Right? And we looked at last week uh the title was God Always Saves chapter 3 to 7. We threw in the intro there because that's when we really started our series and we really looked at how God still used Ezekiel even though he knew his people would reject the message. And isn't that amazing to hear that God can know that you will deny him, but he send you a messenger anyways? So far, all we've built up so far these past seven chapters is we've seen the beginning of the downfall of God's people. And I don't have it up right now. Um, but not yet. Um, but the three times Babylon sieged uh Jerusalem, do you guys remember the dates? Shout them out if you think you know it. The first date was 60 five. Okay. Okay. The the second date was who who knows that one? &gt;&gt; 597. Okay. Mr. ICCM right here. Um the last and final date when Jerusalem was actually taken, which we haven't gotten to that point quite yet. Um Ezekiel was taken in 597. The last date was 58. six. Someone said it. I'm not sure who said it. Um, but congratulations to you. Um, but 586, right? Um, and how God literally gave them three chances to repent. Um, but you know, we see that God still uses Ezekiel in this time to announce judgment. You know, a promise of re, you know, restoration if he decides to repent. And of course, destruction of Jerusalem, destruction of his temple. Let's go to Ezekiel chapter 8 and let's kick off. Ezekiel chapter 8. And uh my title for us today is God's glory is reserved for the righteous. God's glory is reserved for the righteous. We're going to read chapters 8- 15 today. Uh it says in verse one, in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting in front of me. And there the hand of the Lord uh God came down on me. I looked, and there was someone who looked like a man. From what seemed to be his waist down was fire, and from his waist up was something that looked bright, like the gleam of amber. He stretched out what appeared to be a hand and took me by the hair of my head. Then the spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and carried me in visions of God. So the first thing we're going to kind of look at here before we dig into this passage is that this was a vision. So Ezekiel's hair wasn't literally grabbed, but it was the vision of him being literally grabbed. and we're going to see him go to Jerusalem, but it wasn't that he physically was carried there, but instead God took him in a vision to Jerusalem. So, keep that in mind, right? Um, and it says right after that to Jerusalem to the entrance of the inner gate that faces north where the offensive statue that provokes jealousy was located. I saw the glory of the Lord of Israel there like the vision I had seen in the in the plane. Uh, the Lord said to me, \"Son of man, look toward the north.\" I looked to the north and there was this offensive statue north of the altar gate. At the entrance he said to me, \"Son of man, do you see what they are doing here? More detestable acts that the house of Israel is committing so that I must depart from my sanctuary. You will see even more detestable acts.\" See, right now, God is showing Ezekiel why he is departing from his sanctuary. And it's actually the same exact image. Remember you had um from we looked at chapter one and chapter two we were prophesied how there's four cherubam wings that covered them. We had this great image that like it looked terrifying and basically above these four cherubam was a expanse right like a flat throne and it said that it was like lapis lazley and on top of that there was a seat and it described God the father. So right now is seeing that same exact image, but this time it says that a hand reaches down and takes him in a vision to see what is happening inside the temple. And this is super significant because right now we're going to start describing and go into a deep analysis of the scriptures. And I really hope that as we're here today, I want you guys to ask yourself, are you only here to be at church to learn about yourself? Are you only here sitting in these seats taking notes because you're saying, you know, teacher, show me what I need to do to change. You know, I believe that we're truly here with pure motives, if we truly have it, to learn more about God. that us growing, being more like Christ comes out of wanting to learn more about God. I find that today's culture is all about self-help. All these self-help books coming out, all these ways people want to grow and change and they're not even trying to get close to God. But, you know, I believe that we have to, you know, start, you know, having a deep curiosity about who God truly is. And I want you guys Ask yourself, are you fascinated about things in the Bible that have nothing to do with salvation? Are you s fascinated about learning different facts? Learning about why does God do what he does does? Even though it doesn't change your character, it doesn't make you more holy, but it's fascinating, right? Like, you know, God is the creator of absolutely everything. But when he came to earth, he also says to his disciples that at one point he became their friend. You know, imagine you had a friend and the only reason why they ever talked to you was so that you could teach them something. And let's say all of your relationships were like that. No one wanted to be a peer to you. No one wanted just to get to know you. Everyone that ever wanted to talk to you only wanted to get something out of you. We cannot treat God that way. We have to actually I pray that right now when we dig into the analysis of the scriptures, a description of his temple and his and his vision that what it invokes is not just how can I change but just a a childlike curiosity of God. Uh a childlike wonder and that we're here and we want to be disciples grow in our walk with God. Why? because it started with this childlike wonder of who God is and how we can learn more about him. Um, I have three images for you. The the first one, like we won't go into description, is this layout of Solomon's temple, like an overview, and Travis is going to pull that up. Um, so right now we're going to go into a description of really uh Ezekiel's journey to the temple and what he saw. But this is really significant because there were essentially two kind of like walls around the temple. You had within this wall, right? You had the outer court. Um but then you had a second wall which was the inner court. And you see that there were stairs kind of leading up the boat. The temple of God was at the highest hill of Jerusalem. And so when you read the psalms talking about song of psalms of the sense it's literally reaching to the the highest point of Israel which is in Jerusalem to the highest hill in Jerusalem which was uh at the very top was located the temple. So really the temple is the tallest point of all of Israel. It's really cool. Um but it's going to talk about different things. Um, it's going to talk about a description of, you know, an idol being here, people being here. I kind of want you guys to get an image of this. But what I mean by having like a childlike curiosity, could you go to the visual of the uh temple um and this is kind of what it looks like um visually, right? And the inside of the temple was everything was bolt. And if you remember, There's this side is south. This side is north. Do you guys know which way the sun sets? Uh, it says west, right? So, as the sun rises, I believe as the sun rises, the idea or sorry, but the sun would both gate and go straight into this temple that's inlaid with gold. And it was supposed to be like this wondrous thing to see, right? But just some things I've even asked myself looking at pictures like this, right? So this image was used uh for the priest to wash themselves, that wash basin. And I've always wondered this. I have yet to find an answer. Um it's supposed to be like 8t tall. I've always wondered how do they wash themselves? Like do they use like a huge ladle and like scoop it and they just find like the tallest priest to kind of scoop it and pour it on them? Is there like a ladder that they climb up, you know, and like jump into it and like swim around and they they come back out of it? I've tried looking it up and I have found no answer to that question. U and so I kind of reserve that in the list of questions I'm going to ask God when I get to heaven. Um just how did the priest get in this 8t tall bowl? Um, and so I hope that when you read the Bible, you look at these descriptions, you look at genealogy, you're kind of like, what's happening here? Like, I'm just a little confused. But it sparks that childlike wonder. Amen. Um, and uh, let's go to the image of what Ezekiel actually saw. Um, so, you know, we had previously a better layout of it, but we're going to go one by one, and we're not going to read all of chapter eight, but essentially chapter 8 talks about each of these with the exception of number five. Number is mentioned in chapter 11. Um, but it's every time God shows them something, it's in a specific location, right? And if you kind of notice, there is something in every location. There is some form of idol worship, which we'll get into in every single spot, even inside of the temple. Um, and the first thing it talks about in verse 3 to six, uh, is this image of jealousy, which we already read, right? And the idea is that it's just an idolatrous image that provokes God's jealousy of the idea of, you know, when you're jealous, you don't want to share what you have. Well, God doesn't want to share his people with other, of course, idols, right? And so, he's literally saying, \"What are you doing? You are mine.\" Um, in verse 7 to 13, it talks about these animal images and that there are these 70 elders that were secretly worshiping inside one of the chambers of the temple and each had their very own idol. Like the leaders of God's people were each had their own idol. Um, and it said um very specifically in verse 11 that they were doing it because the Lord does not see us. He has abandoned us. Why is that really important? I find that we can believe in God and still perform idol worship even in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Like we understand God is there. We're literally in his temple. Like he is there but he's not with us right now. So I'm just going to do what I want to do. Um it says uh in number three, right? Talks about women weeping for Hamas. Simply that was a Mesopotamian god. that was the god over uh the fertilization of the land. And the idea was that they were literally weeping, crying out to this false god that there would have good crops again, but God cursed the land because of their disobedience and their sin. I find very simply when we don't want to change and we know that there's a solution that'll actually help, but we don't like it, we sometimes even go to God. We're in this temple area, but we're looking for an ultimate solution to our problems. Um, in it says in verse number four, uh, the 25 men worshiping the sun. Uh, that's in verse 16 to 18. That's really significant because it had their backs facing the temple and they physically were facing the sun. And so the idea was that like um they were sitting there you know in God's court area but yet their backs were facing the temple and if you remember the idea that the sun shines in the whole place glorious but instead of focusing on where to go is going towards what is causing that light you know and I think another thing that we can do um as disciples even is we put our attention towards the wrong thing. You know, God is helping you learn these life lessons. And so I might ask you, hey, like what did you learn in this trial you've undergone that, you know, I've really learned to just really believe in myself. You know, I really think that, you know, God has given me all these different strengths. You know, God was trying to humble you, right? And like the idea is that you put your attention, your focus on the wrong thing when God is telling you to turn around. Look what is right behind you. &gt;&gt; Um, and in verse 17 to 18, let's see what it says in Ezekiel at the very end of chapter 8 says, \"And he said to me, do you see this son of man? Is it not enough for the house of Judah to commit the detestable acts they are doing here that they must also fill the land with violence and repeat anger me? Even putting the branch to their nose. Therefore, I will respond with wrath. I will not show pity or spare them. Though they call loudly in my hearing, I will not listen to them. You know, it says briefly that they would put the branch to their nose. And one common thing that would happen in uh that day and age was whenever you are passing like a valley where war just happened or maybe there's a few like dead animal carcasses, you would take the branch of the tree and like keep it really close to your nose so you can smell the aroma from the tree or the leaves and kind of ignore the scent that was happening from the dead bodies or dead carcasses, right? And the idea was that they're causing all this destruction, the consequences of their sin, or maybe even the wicked evilness of the sin themselves, and they kind of put a branch to their nose, like ignoring the effect of it, pretending like it's not there. Some translations say that they put the branch to God's nose. And the idea is that I commit this sin. Yes, it's horrendous, but it's like God, like, smell this. like like don't don't look at my sin like you know like I'm a I'm a good person like let's not focus on like all the bad that's going on and the idea was literally trying to ignore the stench of your sin. That's what it means to put the branch to your nose. And we to ask ourselves why is God showing Ezekiel all all of this? It is because he wants to show Ezekiel that his total annihilation of Jerusalem along with all of its people is not without cause. In every single area meant to worship God, there is idol worship. In every single spot, it says at the very end that they call loudly while they're literally in their sin. You know, imagine God's church where Every single person comes to service, takes note, listens to the lesson, but goes right back to living how they want to live. That was the state of Jerusalem. Let's read Ezekiel chapter 9. And I want us to put on our uh spiritual seat belts here uh because what we're going to read I find is a very challenging concept if not one of the most challenging concepts in the Bible. Um and it's spread all throughout the scriptures. In chapter 9 in verse one it says then he called loudly in my hearing come near executions of the city each of you with a destructive weapon in his hand and I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate which faces north each with the war club in his hand. There was another man among them clothed in linen carrying writing equipment. They came and stood beside the bronze altar. Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherub where it had been to the threshold of the temple. He called to the man clothed in lin and carrying writing equipment. pass through the city of Jerusalem, the Lord said to him, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the detestable practices committed in in it. He spoke uh to the others in my hearing, \"Pass through the city after him, and start killing. Do not show pity or spare them. Slaughter the old men, the young men, the woman, as well as the children and older women. But do not come near anyone who has the mark, but get at my sanctuary. So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple. Then he said to them, \"Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go.\" So they went out killing people in the city. While they were killing, I was left alone. And I fell face down and cried out, \"Oh Lord God, are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel when you pour out your wrath on Jerusalem?\" He answered me, \"The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great and uh the land is full of bloodshed and the city full of perversity for they say the Lord has abandoned the land. He does not see but as for me I will show no pity or spare them. I will bring their conduct down on their own head.\" Then the man clothed in linen and carrying right equipment reported that I have done all that you have commanded me. You know this passage um is quite grim you know in many senses it is literally God's vision showing Ezekiel that he is going to wipe out all of them and you know it talks about six men who had war clubs their agents of you know God's destruction and there is one man with a riding equipment and it said of course spiritually to mark the heads of all of those who are against idol worship. So when the agents of, you know, God's wrath come through, they spare those who were against all the idol worship. And it reminds me of the final sign in Exodus, how you had to put the lamb's blood over your door and then God would come through and if there was no lamb's blood, he would take out the firstborn of that household. And I I think the challenging aspect of this passage is how God literally allowed not sanctioned and made happen the total wiping out of men, women, young and old as well as children. And I want to talk about this concept. I want to give us an understanding of why would God allow even children to die. Let's go to Isaiah chapter 57. Isaiah chapter 57. And I want us to get a good understanding of this because I find many people have objections even to the Bible to God to the scriptures because of maybe even this one singular context. In Isaiah 57 verse one says the righteous person perishes and no one takes it to heart. The faithful are taken away with no one realizing that the righteous person is taken away because of evil. He will enter into peace. They will rest on their beds everyone who lives uprightly. You know, here in this church, we believe that innocent children go to heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, people believe you have to baptize babies, but we do not believe that. I believe it is not just the righteous who go to heaven, but it is the innocent who go to heaven. Those who have severe mental disabilities, who don't know right from wrong, they are going to heaven. Amen. And because of this, you know, remember how in 2 Chronicles we read that God said that there was no remedy for his people. What does that really mean in the context of everything? It means that it reached the point in Israel where every single person born in that land is guaranteed to sin also guaranteed to not repent of their sins. That's what it means of no remedy. that if you were born in this land no matter what because of your environment you will sin and even worse you will not repent of it. God saw that and once he saw that there is no chance anyone is making it to heaven that's when he stepped in. All right this has to stop. Why? Because of course now you have children who are literally destined to go to hell because of the environment that they're growing up around. And you know, I've been in many tough conversations about this and I've come to realize that not believing in God makes you believe that death is the worst thing that could happen to you. &gt;&gt; But in this case, the alternative to dying young is eternity in hell. Like literally God saw the situation and said, \"I cannot allow this many people to go to hell. By me stepping in and at least allowing the innocent to die, they at least get to be in heaven with me.\" But I want to read the scripture because it literally says that the righteous person perishes and no one takes the heart. You know, even as a disciple, seeing people die is hard. Seeing the faithful die is still hard. And God acknowledges that he understands like if if I if I got the news that something happened to Natalie or Anna, I would be devastated. Yes, I believe that she would be in heaven, that my daughter would be in heaven, but it doesn't mean I wouldn't be sad, right? God understands this. And I believe there are scriptures like this that help us help us know that actually the death of the innocent is actually the one of the best things that could happen to them if the alternative is eternity in hell. Let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 4. chapter 4 it says in verse one again I observed all the acts of the oppression being done under the sun look at the tears of those who are oppressed they have no one to comfort them power is with those who oppress them they have no one to comfort them so like literally if you're oppressed or if you're the oppressor there is no one to comfort you in verse two it says so I commended the dead who have already died. But uh more than the living who are still alive. But better than either of them is the one who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil activity that is done under the sun. Why do innocent children die? Because God is actually sparing them from evil. And Isaiah 57 teaches us that as humans, because earth is really all that we know as we're here on earth, it is hard to grasp that. It is hard to grasp that dying is not the worst thing that could happen to you. But you know, God talks about that sometimes death is sparing the good from evil. You know, I think many of us even know of disciples who have passed. Maybe they passed at a time that might have made sense because of age, but maybe it didn't make sense because of their age. Maybe it was way too soon, way too fast. God was sparing them from evil. And I want you guys to believe that. Uh let's go back to Ezekiel chapter 10. And I know it's hard to grasp um and any one of us would be terrified, but there is no pain that is too hard to endure for the goal of comfort from our creator. There is no pain too hard to endure for the goal of having the comfort of our creator. Back in Ezekiel chapter 10, we're going to move on here. uh in verse one, the Bible reads, \"Then I looked and there above the expanse over the heads of the cherubam was something like a throne with the appearance of lapis lapis lazy. The Lord spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, \"Go inside the wheelwork beneath the cherubam. Fill your hands with blazing coal from among the cherubam and scatter them over the city.\" So he went in as I watched. Now the cherubam were standing to the south of the temple. When the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court, then the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherub to the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud and the court was filled with the brightness of the Lord's glory. So this is a very important moment, right? So first, you know, God tells the man clothed in linen with riding equipment to get coal from the wheelwork next to the cherubam. And if you remember, it was cherubam that all on each four corners of this great expanse. And next to them was a wheel. And it within the wheel was the spirit of the living being. And God told the man in linen to get coal from within the spirit and scattered it across the city. If you know in Isaiah that God used coal to touch Isaiah's lips to purify him and said once he touched his lips that your sins are forgiven. So what is happening is God is telling the one who is u marking those to be saved right he is spreading the message of purification across all Jerusalem. Once again God's judgment was about to come but he didn't let it happen without a message of warning. Amen. Um and then right after that we see that it says that the the cloud that was in the temple filled the temple and that the court was filled with the Lord's glory. This is extremely significant because when Moses first built the tabernacle, right, it said that the cloud that was guiding them in the wilderness that was a cloud at day and a fire by night said it rested on the temple on the tabernacle and then when it was on the tabernacle inside of it so that Moses couldn't minister to it. Not until the cloud itself kind of narrowed itself. Can you see the uh visual of the temple? Not until the cloud itself no longer uh filled the entirety of the temple um which is all but this part right here which is the ark of the covenant. And these are cherub. So don't mix cherubim and cherub. They're two different things right? And so when Moses made the tabernacle, it moved from the entire temple. No one could be in the temple, not even Moses, not even the priests until it moved into the holy of holies behind the curtain right here. And then when Solomon built his temple, which is this temple right here, that it said when he dedicated the temple, same thing. It said the glory filled the whole temple. No one could enter it until it moved to above the ark of the covenant. So what is in this passage is the opposite. It is not saying that the temple that the glory went into the temple and then and right above the ark, but it's saying from the ark to the entire temple. Literally, what that means is when no one can minister before God, when the cloud is there, God is kicking everyone out. That is literally what is happening. Whenever the crowd fills the temple, no one can minister before him. So what God is literally saying, get out. I am tired of seeing this wicked idolatry, seeing this rebellious sin. You guys are no longer allowed to be in my temple. And then in verse 18, let's see how it ends. Chapter 10 says, \"Then the glory of the Lord moved away from this threshold. So now it's no longer here. It's no longer at the temple.\" It says, \"And stopped above the cherubam.\" So it left the cherub and left the temple but then it went to above the cherubam who were underneath the expanse of God. So it went to above the cherubam. What was above that expanse? You guys remember the throne. So God literally confiscated the spirit back that is now mine again. Once you had it, once you had my glory, once you had my spirit, but because of all of this wickedness, I am taking it back. You know, the title of our lesson is God's glory is reserved for the righteous. Point number one is keep God's glory. Keep God's glory. And that's a message that not many people want to hear because they don't think that you can lose it. that there is so many churches are being built every single day on this doctrine on that there is literally nothing you can do to lose the glory of God. But it is so obvious in the Bible that there is a point when God is tired of repetitive sin, tired of idolatry, says you know what I am taking this back. This is no longer yours. And this is really important because the moment God took his spirit back, the Israelites are now just like every other nation, just like all these other surrounding nations who who were never with God. God's like, \"All right, you're just like them now. There is no difference.\" And it's so important to be able to keep God's glory. And we understand that, you know, in here we believe that we can lose God's glory. Amen. But you know, I think what could sometimes seep into even us as disciples is this concept of that our past righteousness can condone current unbelief. That our past righteousness can condone current laziness. That our past righteousness can condone current pride, current selfishness, current idolatry, current discord. that because I've been sanctified, I've become a baptized disciple. I've helped people become disciples and overcome of many sins. It's okay if I take a load off. That is not how God works. You know, uh imagine you have a friend and your friend needs a place to stay for a few months. After a few days, maybe he sees your nightstand and a really nice nightstand, but I think my concept of, you know, interior design is better. He takes out your nightstand and puts in his own, but he's not done yet. Let's say he sees your, you know, your your TV stand, your credenza, and he's like, I don't like the color of it, you know, and he wakes you out at work and I was going to change that and you come back and that's, you know, and over time he changes your dishes to his preference. That's he changes your couch to his preference. That's a no no. Not the couch. And let's say he he he drew the final straw. He replaces your bed. [Music] &gt;&gt; How long would he be a welcome guest in your house? &gt;&gt; Not after the after the night. And it's like, did you even like take the stuff out of the drawer? It's like I I wasn't thinking about that, you know. It's like like that the first one it would take the first one that is what is happening here and that's what could happen now that God has given us this place of worship but you know what God I think I want to do some interior decorating &gt;&gt; you've given me how to worship how to make disciples the desire to but you know what if I don't because I'm an introvert I don't have to make disciples let me worship worship you my way. God, you know you we we have to be wholehearted toward you, God, but I had a really hard week. How about everyone else sing with all their heart and I can kind of just whisper it a little bit. God, you you know that if I think it's wholehearted, I believe you think it's wholehearted, right? But that is not how it works. That is not how it works. You know, we have to ask ourselves, you know, how is our disciplehip going right now? &gt;&gt; Not how was it, how has it been, what is the greatest thing you've ever done? How is your disciplehip currently? &gt;&gt; You know, we can't uh be abusing our current relationship with God because of how it looked in the past. &gt;&gt; You know, we have we ask ourel, you know, are we bearing fruit? fruit of the spirit making disciples. How is self-denial? How how was our past quiet time, right? Like like are we looking at our disciplehip through the lens of now? What it looks like currently? We have to keep God's glory. Uh let's go to Ezekiel 11. You know, we can't view righteousness as a savings account to start spending it on redecorating God's temple. God, you've given me this great savings and I've worshiped you all these years. I think I'm going to spend it on some little interior decorating. I I want to I want to change this place up a little bit. You know, I want to redesign my my worship. Maybe it can look this way. That fits my own preference. That is not how God wants us to operate. If we continue in Ezekiel 11 um before this in verse 1 to 15 uh it talks about uh Israel's wicked wicked leaders were plotting evil right and specifically what they were plotting uh that they were giving wicked advice to those within Jerusalem. And that's very interesting to note like a lot of the wickedness was because the leaders were spreading wickedness, right? Um but let's read Ezekiel 11:16 and see what happens. Uh it says uh in verse 16, therefore say this is what the Lord God says. Though I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone. Therefore say, this is what the Lord God says. I will gather you from the people and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered. I will give you the land of Israel. This is the promise of restoration. Verse 18, when they arrive there, they will remove all its abhorrent acts and detestable practice from it. I will give them integrity of hearts and put a new spirit within them. I will remove their heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh so that they will follow my statutes, keep my ordinances, and practice them. They will be my people. I will be their God. But as for those who heart whose hearts pursue their desire for abhorent acting and testful practices, I will bring their conduct down on their own head. This is a declaration of the Lord. You know it takes a soft heart, a heart of flesh to keep God's glory. Um it's quite powerful. It says that God will give them three things. Technically, one of them is taken away, right? I will give them integrity of heart. I will give them a new spirit. And then I will remove their heart of stone. I will remove their hard heart. Uh and this is interesting, right? The word integrity that it says the Hebrew word is and it literally is a translation for the number one. That's it. I will give them one heart. Right? And depending on the translation, right, some say it literally says one heart. I think the NIV says an undivided heart, I believe. Um but the concept is that is really kind of two things that one's own heart is undivided is unwavering in following God following his principles but also the second meaning is that they collectively as a people will have one heart right and and they literally all share the same heart the same mind the same convictions right and it kind of makes sense because to have integrity must mean that people know you have integity If you see a red person, you don't think, \"Oh, he has integity.\" You would only know if you know him. So the idea of having integrity kind of involves not just you having it, but other people knowing it is a twofold concept. And I believe this passage is actually talking about both that it is not one or the other, but it is both a personal one heart towards God, but also a one heart shared amongst the people. Um, I think this is uh super important because uh having a personal heart of integrity is being honest but most importantly being honest with yourself. Uh point number two is dishonesty forces away God. Let's go to Romans chapter 15. Dishonesty forces away God. Hope you're still with me, guys. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter It says in verse four, says, \"For whatever was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that we may have hope through endurance and through the encouragement from the scriptures.\" So, I hope that reading Ezekiel gives you hope and it gives you encouragement. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'd assume that when we're reading this, I kind of think that Paul had a good quiet time on Ezekiel maybe, and that's why he writes this. It says in verse five, \"Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another according to Christ to you so that you may glorify the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mind and one voice.\" You see, it talks about having harmony with one another that it glorifies God. Literally being unified with one another glorifies God. harmony. Literally, it brings music to God's ears. You know, I imagine, you know, worship can be like God going to a barbecue. And here's here's why I say that. Here's why I say that is, you know, he hears the nice music of our unity. You know, he's bumping to it. He likes it. It says that our prayers are a pleasing aroma. He smells the food. He's like cooking. And it says in the Bible that God sings to us. So, He hears the music, smells the cooking, gets in a good mood. He starts sitting and he's he's like walking into the barbecue. It's like nice. Someone give me a plate, right? And that's that's how our unity is to God. That's how our our prayers are to God. Our worship is to God. And literally that when we live in harmony with one another, it is music to God. And we have to see an example of what happens when you're not honest with yourself. How it brings uh disharmony inside the body. Let's go back to Ezekiel 13. Start coming in for a landing here. Ezekiel chapter 13. Uh it says in verse six, they saw false visions talking about the false prophets and their divinations were alive. They claimed this is the Lord's declaration when the Lord did not send them. Yet they wait for the fulfillment of their message. So this is kind of interesting, right? So chapter 11 closes out with Ezekiel telling the exiles of his vision that he saw. uh chapter 12, Ezekiel talks about how bad the um exile will be and how bad it'll be for those who remain in Jerusalem and how some people think that this judgment that Ezekiel is talking about isn't going to happen for a long long time. And God is using Ezekiel to correct them and then it talks about these false prophets. The idea that Ezekiel is saying it's about to happen and these false prophets like no it's not going to happen for a long time. This judgment our sin is not that bad yet. It hasn't reached that point yet. God's judgment, his wrath is not going to come for another many years, right? But Ezekiel here is condemning the false prophets. And it's interesting because it says that they're not getting word from God, yet they still believe it's going to happen. It's kind of like why would they think that? Like if God is not literally speaking to them, why would they still convince themselves that their message is going to happen even though they know that they made it up? Well, in Ezekiel 13:10, I believe it gives us the answer. Says, \"Since they have led my people astray by saying peace when there is no peace, and since when a flimsy wall is being built, they plaster it with white wash.\" Literally, they the false prophets hit the sin of God's people with the landlord special. You know, is it rusty? Is it maybe molding? Is it about a break? You know, just put some white paint on it. let's just let's just pretend like it's not there. And like literally their plan was like, you know, let's just bend over it and let's just forget like this whole problem, right? But it says that God exposes those foundations, right? the idea that even if you cover it up, make it look nice, you come to church, you look good, you see with all your heart, God will expose your idolatry, &gt;&gt; especially when you're trying to cover it up. And in verse 19 of chapter 13, he says, \"You profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. You put those to death who should not die and spared those who should not live when you lie to my people who listened to lies.\" So why were they doing this? Instead for for bread, for grain, for barley, right? And they did it what? For gain. They did it for profit. But it's very important at the very end. It says that you lie to my people who listen to life. So why ultimately was all of this happening is because God's people wanted to hear. They wanted to hear the lies. Let's jump to verse 22. I find this quite interesting. It says, \"Because you have disheartened the righteous person with life.\" When false doctrine is spread, all these churches, people are flocking to these church that preach these false messages for us who've decided to be disciples. It's disheartening. It's what are they doing? Like I'm trying so hard. I reach out to my friends time and time again. Why do they still go to this spot that makes them never change? &gt;&gt; And God acknowledges that. It is disheartening. And it says, \"And because you have supported the wicked person, but he does not turn from the evil way to save his life. Therefore, you will no longer see false practice divination. I will rescue my people from your hand. Then you will know that I am the Lord.\" You see, it's interesting. It said that they supported the people with their wickedness. I find that what does it look like to support people for their wickedness? Um is that when people uh they like to listen to lies, they like to hear these false messages. Why? Because they want to support their current lifestyle. &gt;&gt; When when you hear lies of what you want to hear, it feels like support. You come to a church, you sit in a Bible study saying you have to repent. You kind of you then you go back home and you on their Facebook page or Instagram post. These guys are like preaching a false doctrine. Why? Because they don't like how it made them feel. Simple. They they want they want to feel supported in their own way. And so what is being dishonest with yourself really? What does it mean when one listens to or preaches all these different false doctrines? Well, I believe the answer is in the next chapter in verse one. Chapter 14. Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me. Then the word of the Lord came to me. Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and have put their sinful stumbling blocks in front of themselves. Should I actually let them inquire of me? Therefore, speak to them and tell them this is what the Lord God says. If anyone from the house of Israel sets up idols in his heart and puts his sinful stumbling block in front of himself and then comes to the prophet, I the Lord will answer him appropriately. I will answer them according to his many idols so I may take hold of the house of Israel by their hearts. They are all in stray from me because of their idols. You know, people who get lost in false doctrine, it's easy to think of, well, they're innocent. They're They're they're just succumbing to this this message. That sounds good. Well, it started with the idol in their hearts. It it started with before they obeyed false doctrine, they were already looking for it, looking for a way to support how they want to worship. And I I think we have to be very cautious of this because what is idol worship in one's heart looks like? It looks like when someone says, you know, tell me that my sin is not that bad. Please, someone tell me that it's okay to act this way in pride and arrogance and outbursts of anger because of my situation, right? It's understandable. Therefore, it's it's condonable, right? Like I can do this, you know, tell me that it's okay not to share my faith. So only certain people have that kind of gift. I can just share the way I want to share, right? And it's this idea of saying, \"Please tell me what what way I can confirm my current belief system. What way that you can support me instead of me knowing how to support the scriptures and build God up?\" And I I find that it's really important, right? Because someone who is truly honest with themselves, has a heart full of integrity, is harmonious with the the disciples around them. truly honest with themselves likes to hear what they don't want to hear. That's what it means to be honest with yourself. Do you enjoy hearing what you don't like to hear? It it sounds almost like a paradox, right? But it's like when you hear things that are challenging, things that even make you start to think that the person telling you these things is actually an accuser, an enemy, someone who doesn't have your interest in mind. Someone who's actually honest with themselves says, \"I need that more. I need more of this stuff that makes me question my reality. I need more of this stuff that makes me realize that I don't know what I'm doing. I need more of this stuff that when people talk to me about all the ways that I'm going wrong, that it makes me want to put my walls up. I need that.\" And that's what it means to be honest with yourself because temporary tempor temporary uncomfortability produces a wellspring and an eternity of holiness of peace and of hope and you're willing to go through that temporary uncomfortability that temporary hurt and you know the rest of the chapter it closes out with this concept of even if Noah right who built the ark Daniel, which you know, of all the characters in the Old Testament, there's really only one who it didn't show a flaw for in terms of giving an extensive story, that is Daniel. It didn't really, if you read the whole book of Daniel. It doesn't express, it showed a flaw for David, flaws for Moses, flaw for the other prophets, but there wasn't really a flaw in Daniel. And that's important because it says Noah, Daniel, and Job, even if they were in Jerusalem telling people to repent, had the most perfect example, they wouldn't even be able to save their families. That is how bad the state of Jerusalem was. That it said that if these three were there preaching consistently, only those three would be saved. That was the condition of Jerusalem. And in uh verse 23 uh God uh consoles Ezekiel and it says that Ezekiel you will be consoled you know you will be at peace and comforted when you see the remnant of Jerusalem's action because remember Ezekiel was taken in the second exile when the third one was going to wipe out Jerusalem the temple and he's probably wondering God how he's going to wipe out all these different people God actually comfort him comforted him by letting him see all of the people's wickedness and that he would know that God's wrath was not without cause. He didn't do it without a reason. Chapter 15, we'll close out this uh section and it simply talks about how you know Jerusalem cannot escape God's fire that they will be consumed no matter what it is too late for them. And I think about it in this way, right? that God could have ended it there. Like with the destruction of Jerusalem, the destruction of the temple, he literally could have stopped the Bible right here. Said that there there's no more there's no more Bible. There's no more other scriptures. There there's no there's no plan of redemption, no plan of restoration in that that humanity everything is done for. There there's no hope. But Amen. That's not what he did. You know, I want you guys to think about this that Jesus is coming considering the fact that God said, you know what, here is the ultimate plan of redemption. You know, I took away my spirit, the glory left, but I'm going to establish such a permanent covenant that as long as there are wholehearted, faithful, committed disciples here on earth, my glory would never leave. And that happened through Jesus. And that when all seemed lost, when it seemed like, is God's glory ever going to come back? He let it come back through the sacrifice of his son, through the coming of the new covenant. And I believe that should cause us to realize how incredible it is the time that we're living in. Well, what an incredible thing that God could have ended it all right there that humanity is lost. You know what? I will still make a plan of redemption. So, what does that mean that we should do? I believe at the core, we have to be honest with that. We have to allow ourselves to hear what we find uncomfortable even if it hurts us because it helps us keep God's glory because God's glory is reserved for the righteous. So, I hope you enjoyed today's lesson. God bless you.",

    "summary": "This sermon, \"God's Glory Is For The Righteous,\" analyzes Ezekiel 8-15, revealing the pervasive idolatry within Jerusalem that prompted God's judgment and the departure of His glory from the temple. Speaker Malik Speckman emphasizes that God's glory is not an unchangeable possession but can be lost through persistent sin, urging disciples to maintain a sincere, undivided heart and reject the self-deception of internal idolatry. He challenges listeners to foster a childlike curiosity for God, live in genuine harmony, and avoid accepting lies that condone personal wickedness instead of pursuing true repentance.",

        "insight": "The speaker explains this passage details Ezekiel's vision of rampant idolatry within Jerusalem's temple, including an 'offensive statue,' secret animal images worshipped by elders, women weeping for Tammuz, and men worshiping the sun. God reveals these detestable acts to Ezekiel to show that His impending judgment is not without cause, highlighting that even in sacred spaces, His people were deeply immersed in rebellion and self-deception."

        "insight": "This challenging section describes God's command for widespread destruction in Jerusalem, sparing only those marked for grieving the city's sins. The speaker addresses the difficult concept of God allowing the death of women, children, and the elderly, asserting that in a society where 'no remedy' existed and all were destined to sin without repentance, God mercifully spared the innocent from a life leading to eternal hell, referencing Isaiah and Ecclesiastes to explain that dying can sometimes be a protective act from evil."

        "verse": "Ezekiel 10:1-18",
        "insight": "This passage chronicles the departure of God's glory from the temple, initially filling the inner court and then moving from the threshold to above the cherubim (and the throne of God). The speaker highlights this as a profound warning that God's glory can be lost due to persistent wickedness, emphasizing that when God's spirit withdraws, His people become indistinguishable from other nations and are no longer allowed to minister before Him."

        "insight": "Ezekiel 11 promises a future restoration where God will gather His people, remove their 'heart of stone,' and give them a 'heart of flesh' and 'one heart' (integrity or an undivided heart). The speaker interprets this as both a personal commitment to God and a collective unity among His people, linking it to Romans 15:5-6 which states that living in harmony glorifies God with 'one mind and one voice,' demonstrating that a soft, undivided heart is crucial for keeping God's glory."

      {
        "verse": "Ezekiel 13:6-23, Ezekiel 14:1-5",
        "insight": "These chapters expose false prophets who preach 'peace when there is no peace,' covering up sin with 'whitewash,' and people who willingly listen to these lies for 'gain.' The speaker explains that this dishonesty 'disheartens the righteous' and 'supports the wicked' by condoning their lifestyles. He concludes that the root of falling for false doctrine is often 'idols in their hearts' (Ezekiel 14), meaning people seek out messages that affirm their desires for sin, rather than truly seeking God's will."

    "transcript": "I want to talk about a little bit uh of the state of this country right now. You know, according to American time use survey, Americans spend an average of 34 minutes a day socializing. 34 minutes a day, literally half an hour a day socializing. Uh, a Harvard graduate study says that 21% of US adults feel lonely, but specifically disconnected from families, their community, and the world. And if you ask a general statement, hey, do you feel lonely with no context, um, other studies say around 50 to 57%. &gt;&gt; But when you get specific and you say like having no one around you, they say around 21%. Uh, right now it is said that 59.2 2 million Americans in the last year, the past year, uh have received some sort of mental health treatment or counseling. 59.2 million Americans. It's a big amount. Um in comparison, in 2002, the amount of Americans that have received mental health counseling or treatment was uh 27 million. So the difference is since 2002 to now, 32 uh 32 million Americans more now go to mental health counseling and receive mental health treatments. So it's nearly doubled since 2002, the amount of people that go and attend uh help for their mental health. But since 2002, suicide rates have risen 30%. Interesting, right? Uh I'm going to look at one more. I want a p a picture to be painted here. It is said that uh right now uh well actually we go back also in 2002 the percentage of US adults that reported that their mental health was in excellent condition was 74%. So it's up to 74% of adults would say oh my mental health is in excellent condition. But now once again since 2002. Now in 2025, the amount of adults that say their mental health is in excellent condition is 31%. Half the amount. So we doubled the people receiving help, but we half the amount of people saying that they're in good condition. Isn't that interesting? Um, I want to talk about this because, you know, I'm not saying I actually think in many ways these things can be helpful, but there is only one thing that is true that will always help you, and that is the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you know, I believe that in today's day and age, there is a famine of truth. &gt;&gt; There there is an epidemic of people relying on anything but God. And I I think of times in the Bible when God had his prophet and it seemed like the whole world was against him. The the whole world was uh against the one that God chose to preach to the people to bring them out of darkness. And I would like to think with all that is going on in today's society, how much darkness people are in, how would a prophet from the Old Testament be treated today? H if Moses was here, if Elijah was here, how would they be treated in today's society? Let's go to Acts chapter 2. &gt;&gt; We're going to talk a little bit about prophets. &gt;&gt; Not prophet Brown though. Though he is a good prophet, he is a good prophet. Next lesson, next point. Um, in Acts chapter 2 and verse 17, it says, \"And it will be in the last days, says God, I will pour out my spirit on all people. Then your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams. I will even pour out my spirit on my servants in those days, both men and women, and they will prophesy.\" So in the kingdom right here and right now because those who have chosen to become baptized disciples in Christ Jesus, we are now prophets in the new covenants. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible to think about? And for all those who are going through darkness, going through valleys, we are the ones that God sends. And you know, we're going to so that we don't mistake it, we're going to look at how a prophet lived in the Old Testament to reflect on what we should do in today's day and age. Our title is we will prophesy. Let's go to Ezekiel chapter 1. We're going to look at an example of a prophets and let's see if let's see how we deal with her. In Ezekiel chapter 1 in verse one it says in the 13th year in the fourth month on the fifth day of the month while I was among the exiles by the chbar canal the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. So we're about to see the vision that Ezekiel had. But you know at this point in time he was in exile with the other other Israelites who went into exile because of their sin. specifically, they're in the nation of Babylon as captives. So, he's there just chilling with the bros in exile. And then it literally says that the heavens opened up. Like, imagine you're minding your own business on a regular Tuesday. You want to have your quiet time by the beach and next thing you know, like it seems like the sky like unzips and just opens up. And we're about to see what he just saw. It says in verse four, I looked and there was a whirlwind coming from the north, a huge cloud with fire flashing back and forth and a brilliant light all around it. In the center of the fire, there was a gleam like amber, the likeness of four living creatures came from it, and this was their appearance. They looked something like a human, but each of them had four faces and four wings. Their legs were straight and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, sparkling like the gleam of polished bronze. They had human hands under their wings on their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings. Their wings were touching the creature the touching. The creatures did not turn as they moved. Each one went straight ahead. Their faces looked something like the face of a human. And each of the four had the face of a lion on the right, the face of an ox on the left, and the face of an eagle. Let's go to verse 14. The creatures were darting back and forth like flashes of lightning. When I looked at the living creatures, there was one wheel on the ground beside each of the four creatures. The appearance of the wheels and the craftsmanship was like the gleam of barrel, and all four had the same likeness. Their appearance and craftsmanship was like the wheel within a wheel. When they moved, they went in any of the four directions without turning as they moved. Their four rims were all were tall and onspiring, completely covered with eyes. When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them. And when the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. Go to verse 22. Over the heads of the living creatures, the likeness of an expanse was spread out. It gleamed like small inspiring crystal. And under the expanse their wings extended one toward another. They each also had two wings covering their bodies. When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of a huge torrent, like the voice of the Almighty, and the sound of tommo like the noise of an army. When they stopped, they lowered their wings. A voice came from above the expanse over their heads. When they stopped, they lowered their wings. something like a throne with the appearance of Lapis Lazerie with above the expanse over their heads. On the throne, high above was someone who looked like a human. From what seemed to be his waist up, I saw gle a gleam like amber with what looked like fire enclosing it all around. From what seemed to be his waist down, I also saw a light a brilliant light all around him. The appearance of the brilliant light all around was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the likeness of the g the Lord's glory. When I saw it, I fell face down and heard a voice speaking. Travis, can you pull up the uh visual that I have here? Imagine one day you're just sitting with your friends and then out of nowhere that just comes right in front of you. What in Ezekiel's uh response was appropriate. He just fell face down. And this was the most accurate image I could find. You have the crystal expanse, the the two wheels that kind of over overlapped each other. You have the wings, the foreheaded creatures, and like I just imagine like your your heart stops way too long and you should have died, but you're you're so in awe that you don't feel like it's the right time to die yet. You're just like, should I be dead or should I keep looking at this? You know, but that is what Ezekiel saw just some random day. No warning, no no no no no, no one told him this is what happened. It just instantly happened one day. Uh Travis, you can bring it up. But I want you guys to see that because quote number one is simply uh the vision of a prophets. You know, God gives his prophets a vision. And one's conclusion to receiving a vision from God is simple and pure, humble submittance unto God. Well, you can do nothing but fall face down. Like the the comparison of power is like trying to stop a heavy duty train with a with a a flimsy sheet of paper. like you're like what? I have no comparison to what is happening right in front of me. And humble submittance unto God comes after fear to fear God. And you know, you guys know the um the trending video that's been happening recently with the uh the cold play cam with um the the the guy is some CEO or works for some company and he's with a a secretary or some coworker. He's already married and he's literally just caught shooting in the actor on the jumbo crop &gt;&gt; and it's just right there in full display and they're minding their own business. I think they're kind of like standing And then what? And then and it's showing for a few seconds and once they notice that they're up there, they like split. Like they scurry like cockroaches. And it's crazy because up until the point they had no thought at all, if anyone is watching, but once they see their sin in full display, they felt instant fear and in a superficial way repented, I guess you could say. And really shows what happens when you actually have fear. It gets your act together. &gt;&gt; You know, Anna, Anna is funny, you know, because if let's say um like, you know, she might give Matt an attitude because she's, you know, screaming for a cake or whatever it is. Ask us what babies do, you know, they just want what they want. And if she's like fighting back, throwing a tantrum, and then I'm like, Anna, she like, \"Wait a minute.\" You know, that's that, you know, like, and that's what happens when there is fear. You get your act together. And you know in Exodus chapter 14 or the turn there after the Israelites had crossed the Red Sea um and then God uh after he split the water and the Egyptians ran after them chasing the Israelites, the water came back in and crushed Pharaoh and his whole army. And right after that it says that the Israelites saw the great power that the Lord used against the Egyptians. The people feared the Lord and they obeyed and they believed in the Lord and his servant Moses. See, when you have a fear of the Lord, you then believe. &gt;&gt; Why did God give Ezekiel this grandiose vision is so he can be in awe, be in fear, and then have unwavering belief in the Lord. And I want to ask you guys today, do you believe that God is still working powerfully in your lives? And if you've repented of your sin, if you are continually renewing yourself, I'm telling you right now, you are amongst the less than 1 percententers of people in the world who have genuine integrity, who understand what perseverance means, what it means to be loyal to people, how to give your heart truly 100% of your heart to something. Because the amount of people that don't understand that is staggering. God is working powerfully in your lives if you're a baptized disciple. &gt;&gt; And think of it like many of us, we've had to overcome addiction or we've helped other people overcome addiction. We've had to overcome trauma, overcome hatred towards other people. And then helping others overcome trauma, helping others overcome hatred, that is power. People live with those things haunting them until they're great. But yet God is working powerfully in our lives. &gt;&gt; And I want to urge all of us to do two things. One, remember how God has previously worked powerfully in your lives. Remember that because if he gave you this great vision that you can now believe un undoubtedly in him, remember that. But and secondly is now let him continue to work powerfully. Don't do not drown out God's vision. You know when Jesus went to his hometown he was unable to do miracle many miracles there. Do you guys know why? Why was Jesus unable to do miracles in his home? Because of their lack of faith. Jesus God in the flesh raising people from the dead, you know, doing these great miracles, you know, walking on water, healing the blind, healing the sick. But yet when he comes to a town that has little to no faith, he couldn't do any miracles. See, we need to remember how God works powerfully in our lives so we can continue to help others as well. &gt;&gt; But if we have no faith and we don't remember his power, how can he work powerfully through us? &gt;&gt; Let's go to let's keep reading. Ezekiel chapter 2. Let's remember the vision of a prophets. In Zuk chapter 2 though, we'll move on to verse one. Right after that, he says, he said to me, son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak with you. As you spoke to me, the spirit entered me and set me on my feet. And I listened to the one who was speaking to me. He said to me, \"Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to the rebellious pagans.\" See, it's interesting to think about because it talks about the Israelites being God's children, his beloved. But when they rebelled against him, God called them rebellious pagans. Uh, and then it says, \"Who have rebelled against me, the Israelites and their ancestors have transgressed against me to this day. The descendants are obstinate and hard-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you must say to them, this is what the Lord God says.\" whether they listen or refuse to listen for they are rebellious house. They will know that a prophet has been among them. Point number one was the vision of a prophet. Point number two right now is the message of a prophets. See God gave Ezekiel a message after he showed him this great vision. It's kind of crazy to think about because literally God showed him something that would have my at least me my heart would stop. But then God doesn't even explain the vision that he just saw. He just immediately moved on said, \"All right, you got it. I'm I'm pretty powerful. Here's a message.\" And I I think you know his response response before receiving the message was he fell uh face down in fear. And it said that God asked him to stand up, but then it said that the spirit stood him up on his feet. I find that when you're paralyzed in fear, God will help you stand up &gt;&gt; if you allow him. &gt;&gt; But when he stands you up, he's not going to just take the time to address your fears. He's going to immediately give you a message. You know, I think sometimes we really hope that we can talk about our fears and I think the Bible talks about confessing our sin. We have to get open about things that are happening in our lives. But at the same time, to overcome these fears, God doesn't even want us to address them. Remember when we looked at Moses in the burning bush, &gt;&gt; very similar, he was in awe. He was in fear and then God immediately gave him a message. It's a constant pattern in the scriptures. And you know, I think it's quite interesting because God gives specific emphasis on the fact that he must say it whether they listen or not. You know, the message is just as much as it is for those who hear it as it is for those who receive it, for those who have been given the task to spread God's message. You know, in uh Ezekiel chapter 2 and verse 8, we'll look at this even further. Like I said, we'll do a 40m minute lesson in 20 minutes. It says in verse eight, \"And you saw the man, listen to what I tell you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.\" So I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me and he unrolled it. Sorry. And there was a a written scroll in it. When he unrolled it before me, it was written on the front and back. Words of lamentation, mourning, and woe were written on it. He said to me, \"Son of man, eat what I eat what you find here. Eat the scroll. Then go and speak to the house of Israel.\" So I opened my mouth and he fed me the scroll. Son of man, he said to me, \"Feed your stomach and fill your belly with this score I'm giving you.\" So I ate it and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. I hope the The word of God is as sweet as honey today. Amen. And I find it quite interesting because you know God is not only giving him the message but he's telling him to digest it, take it in. But what is written on the scroll? It says words of lamentation, mourning and woe. You know lamentation, there are songs and songs of sadness. You know mourning, you know, you're grieving over loss. And woe is talking about wrath and destruction. That sounds pretty negative to me, but how does it describe the taste? Sweets. Sweet as honey. You know, I I find that for disciples, you hear messages of wrath and woe and you're like, I am so glad I'm on the other side. Why? Because you don't think about the wrath that's coming, but God's promise that happens through there. Uh we're I think of two different passages where I read this. Go to Psalm chapter 30. How is it sweet but at the same time you you think of negative emotions? Wrath, woe, lamentations, mourning. I don't understand why it would be tasting sweet. Well, let's look at passages that can be very similar in Psalm chapter 30. There's a problem on that. Uh Psalm chapter 30 in verse 5 it says, \"For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor a lifetime. Weeping may stay overnight, but there is joy in the morning.\" See, pain, wrath, tears are only temporary. Let's go to Psalm 126. Psalm 126. It says in verse six, \"Though one goes along weeping, carrying the bag of seed, he will surely come back with shouts of joy, carrying his sheep.\" you know, pain, wrath, tears, sadness, all these different things, mourning, lamentations, woe, they're all temporary. But I find that a prophet who has God's message doesn't focus on the temporary destruction, but the eternal salvation. So, how is it about woe, lamentation, and mourning, but yet it tastes sweet? Because when you have God's message, you focus on eternity. You focus on what God has in store for you. You know, I've had times in my walk with God where I have felt like I have to share my faith. Times where I'm telling myself, you know, to be a good dad, to support my family, I I have to wake up early. I have to get a good start to my day. And even before I uh fell away, I remember um when I was a disciple for about a year before I fell away that the thoughts that would come to my mind is I have to go to time. Like I have to go to meetings of the body. I have to go to meetings. I have to go to Bible talks. And you know, I find that they're often for different reasons as well. It could be because you're trying I'm trying to people preach. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm trying to put on a a good impression, a good show. Um, it could be I don't want to disappoint myself. Maybe because I'm so used to giving up and failing. I may not have any faith to continue, but I have even less faith in myself because I know what happens when I give up. You know, sometimes even it could be out of fear like I have to keep going because I don't want to go to hell. Right? I find that there are different reasons why we tell ourselves we have to do these different things. But, you know, as of recently, I was talking to Nat about this. You know, I've been feeling more of this desire of like I I want to share more. Like I I remember when I was getting advice from other uh dads who became fathers in the ministry and they said, \"Hey, Malik, you know what you should do is wake up every day at 5 a.m.\" And then I'm like, \"Maybe I can find another brother advice.\" Um, and pretty consistently every single one said 5:00 a.m. The only one that said anything different was 5:30. They all And I'm like, what? You know, like, how do you do that? Right? And I would tell myself, I have to I have to I have to. But lately, I've been thinking like I I want to like I want to have longer quiet times with God, you know? Like I I want to have that time, that time when it's just me and God. I want to I want to like go now I have to go I want to go to the gym right all these different things you know I I I want to share my faith more like all these different things and you know all these things that used to be like I have to are now becoming like you know I actually want to do these different things and I find when we have a um that sometimes we can have a have to instead of a want to mindset &gt;&gt; you know we could have a I got to instead of I get two mindsets. You know, I only remember one lesson from that time before I fell away um when I was a teenager, when I was a disciple for about a year. I remember a single lesson and it was done by our brother Sal Velasco at men's midweek service and he I remember one specific thing he said. He says, \"Brothers, you don't uh got to come to midweek, you get to come to.\" And I was like, \"Whoa.\" you know, like and to me that that's really stuck with me, you know, in terms of like how do I view my walk with God, you know, like I don't got to share his message. I get to share his message, &gt;&gt; you know. I don't have to be a fully committed disciple where I'm, you know, having daily quiet time seeking first his kingdom. I want to be a fully committed disciple where I get to do those things. Let's go to Colossians chapter 3. Let's close out here. &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 3. &gt;&gt; And I really want to, you know, ask you guys, you know, do you have a have to mindset in your walk with God or a want to mindset with your walk with God? &gt;&gt; Do you have a I got to mindset in your walk with God or I get to mindset in your walk with God? In Colossians chapter 3, you know, Before that, let's go to Matthew 16. I have another Let's look at this one. Matthew chapter 16. This passage is actually interesting because right before what we're about to look at, Jesus gives Peter the keys to the kingdom of heaven. He literally gives Peter a mission, a task, what he is bound to do. And let's see what happens right after in verse 21. From then on, Jesus began to point out to his disciples that it was necessary for him to go through Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and scribes, be killed and be raised the third day. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. See, you know, sometimes you're given a mission and you get a little arrogance. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's like, oh, you know, I must be the best of the disciples. Maybe I can tell Jesus a few things or two. You know, maybe sometimes we do that, you know, like in our walk with God, like we become so confident and we doing so much for God that maybe we think we can alter the Bible a few times. Like no, &gt;&gt; that's not how it works. The standard never changes. &gt;&gt; And what does he say? He says, \"Oh no, Lord. This will never happen to you.\" Jesus turns and told Peter almost like he turned. I can imagine like Jesus like like turning like what did you just say? Uh he says get behind me Satan. &gt;&gt; You are a hindrance to me because you're not thinking about God's concerns but human concerns. You know this is what happens when you adopt the I got to mindset or I have to mindset. You literally view part your walk with God as a side quest only to gather more XP for your main quest of what you're trying to do in your life. You know, God, the Bible is not a side mission. It is the main quest. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when you sometimes you literally do your walk with God, oh, I guess it's a little detour to what I I would actually rather do this. This is what I would rather accomplish. But we have to have a uh I want to mindsets. I get to mindset. Let's go to Colossians chapter &gt;&gt; and we'll close out here. Now we'll close out here in Colossians chapter 3. It says in verse one, \"So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things above where Christ is se at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things, for you died, and your life is hidden with Christ and God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.\" You know, I love the part where it says, \"For you dies.\" Literally, coming to God is not an upgrade. Coming to God is not you 2.0. It It says that when we get to heaven, we will have new names, new bodies. Like, you are no longer you when you become a disciple. And it says that, you know, because we've been raised with Christ in the waters of baptism, it's alluding to says, but we must set our minds on things above, not on earthly things. And really ask yourself, what are you mainly concerned about today? Are you concerned, as it mentioned in Matthew 16, about human things, &gt;&gt; or are you concerned about things of God? You know, I believe family that we have a great opportunity here to be prophets in God's new covenants &gt;&gt; where we are literally co-airs with Christ. &gt;&gt; And no matter what you've been through, God has given you a message as a prophet. No matter what you've experienced, what you might have seen, God has given you a vision of a prophets that you may fear him and walk humbly besides him. And so let us really consider what are we really here for. You know, we we have been given the spirit as the prophets were in the Old Testament, but now in the New Testaments, we are every single one of us are prophets. Amen. So we have to have the message of one because we have the vision of one. So let's unite as prophets in God's kingdom. To God be all the glory.",

    "summary": "The sermon, \"We Will Prophesy,\" highlights the growing societal issues of loneliness and mental health, attributing them to a famine of truth and a lack of reliance on God. The speaker asserts that in the new covenant, all baptized disciples are prophets, drawing parallels to Old Testament prophets like Ezekiel. He emphasizes that prophets first receive a vision of God's power leading to humble submission and then are given a message, which, though it may contain difficult truths, is ultimately sweet because it focuses on eternal salvation. The sermon concludes by urging believers to shift from a \"have to\" to a \"want to\" mindset in their faith, prioritizing God's concerns as their main life quest.",

    "transcript": "We want to get into the word so we can have divine instruction for how to live our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in John chapter 1, it says in verse 35, It says, \"The next day, John was standing with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the lamb of God.\" The two disciples heard him say this and followed Jesus. When Jesus turned and noticed them following him, he asked them, \"What are you looking for?\" They said to him, \"Rabbi,\" which means teacher, \"Where are you staying?\" \"Come and you'll see.\" he replied. So they went and saw where he was staying and they stayed with him that day. It was about 4 in the afternoon. You know, our title for us today is simply what are you looking for? What are you looking for? You know, this is Jesus's first time speaking um that John records in his book, right? And I I find it very significant because this is what John wanted to start with. This is what John wanted to begin the journey of how Jesus lived and how he died. And it starts with a question. I find many people today when it comes to their relationship with God do not want to be questioned. &gt;&gt; They want to say, \"I'm a Christian. I'm a believer. I'm good the way that I am.\" But Jesus starts off his ministry to those who want to follow him with a question. What are you here for? &gt;&gt; What are you seeking? what are you looking for? And you know in in his question I find it very significant because many people could come to Jesus seeking the wrong things. What what do they expect or what do they put what kind of expectations do they put on Jesus in the first place? I find many people they could live their life in fear and they only obey God in expectance of blessings and safety. &gt;&gt; And it sounds good. God wants you to be safe. He wants to protect you. But he's not a vending machine where you just put your money in and you get exactly what you want. You know, I find life is full of mystery. It's full of trials and challenges and and that's the great adventure that you've given us. That is life. But when you try to use God because of your own fear as a way to overcome trials in a way that's actually unbiblical, you put this wrong view of God and you seek him for the wrong reasons. And we're going to go into a few other reasons why people might seek God, but they're not the right reasons. &gt;&gt; Another way I believe is people they believe that God did create the world. Amen. But that after he created, he took a step back and somehow God is no longer involved in the lives of people and all we have to do is apply God's principles and we'll be totally okay. But when you do that, you neglect a relationship with him. It is now entirely focused on how can I live life through his principles. I don't need to pray. I don't need to fast. I don't need to have a community. I don't need anything. All I need to do is obey and I'll be good. That is not how God wants us to come to him either. You know, some people come to Jesus because they want to be valued. And God does have a measurable love for us. But when you come to him in an expectation of how much he can value, how much he can value you, then you only do things because you believe it'll increase your value. If I do more for you, God, then I know you'll love me even more than you already said you do love me, God. if if I you know go on this mission team, if I could you know sacrifice more and even these are commands in the Bible. Your value is not based off of those things. I find another reason some people come to God is, you know, they're unable to control and regulate their own emotions and and they they live life as a victim to it because that's what the world teaches you that that you that your your emotions are what control you rather than you control your emotions. And so coming to God is rather an experience of of and if anything spiritual substance abuse of coming to church, reading the Bible only to get your next fix of feeling good about yourselves because outside of coming to church, aside of reading the Bible, you feel terrible. And so you literally use God as a drug, church as a drug, prayer as a drug. when those things are good in communion with God, but you're supposed to be at peace always, be at joy, be joyful always, &gt;&gt; not just on your next fix. &gt;&gt; And all of these reasons, you know, people use to kind of come to God, but in reality, you're still running from sin. You're using uh you're using God to bottle up your sin, bottle up your flesh, but God wants you to overcome it. God wants you to walk with him. And so you can not just avoid the flesh, but no longer have it be a part of you. Jesus wants you to live life that is totally free. Let's go to John chapter 6. We're we're going to go in depth a little bit of what are we really looking for in our relationship with God. In John chapter 6 in verse 60 it says therefore when many of the disciples heard they said this teaching is hard who can accept it. See right before this moment Jesus is preaching on how he is the bread of life. If you want to live if you want to have enduring life you have to come to him. Literally he preached that there is no other way except for him. And for many people that's a hard teaching. It's like, well, maybe if I slightly alter the path, maybe if I can throw in my own way of life in there. But Jesus says, no, I am the only way. And those who followed him, because his disciples said that this is a hard teaching. See, if you feel like Jesus teachings are hard as a disciple, that's fine. They felt it too. But let's see the wrong response in that. However, in verse 61, Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, asked them, \"Does this offend you?\" Once again, another question. Does this offend you? Then what if you were to observe the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? The spirit is the one who gives life. The flesh doesn't help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. But there are some among you who don't believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning those who did not believe in the one who would betray him. He said, \"This is why I told you that no one could come to me unless granted to him by the father.\" From that moment, many of his disciples turned back and no longer accompany him. So Jesus said to the 12, \"You don't want to go away too, do you?\" Sim Peter answered, \"Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of eternal life. You have come to believe and know that you are the holy one of God. You know, I believe in this passage we learn something very crucial about Jesus. That he is the master of exposure therapy. &gt;&gt; He mastered it. He created it. And because of it, many people walked away because of it. &gt;&gt; And what it is is they we have all these negative emotions, thoughts and feelings. And Jesus was a professional bringing them to the surface, &gt;&gt; making them become a real reality rather than coming into your walk with God, having them hidden, tucked away at the recesses of your heart, says, \"No, let's bring it to the surface so we can deal with this.\" And I was looking it up really what is exposure therapy so we can compare it to what he's doing right here. And exposure therapy is what is done to rewire one's uh brain response to fear, distress and anxiety by anxiety by gradually and safely confronting the source that gives you that fear that brings about those negative emotions. And it's broken down in five steps. One is you reduce avoidance. Meaning that whatever is causing those negative emotions, you face them head on. You no longer avoid them. And why is that super important is because it says that avoidance fuels fear. The the the more you stand away from it, the the more you want to avoid it in the first place. But it's not about uh avoidance but actually being actually overcoming the sin, overcoming fear, overcoming distress rather than keeping it at arms length. Amen. The second step is it weakens the fear circuit part of your brain. And what that means is that those when the more you understand what causes these negative feelings, emotions, and thoughts, you the more you understand them, the less you're afraid of them because you actually understand, wait a minute, this isn't actually promote real danger. I'm making it produce real danger, but it's not a real danger. And the more you understand it, the more you confront it, the more you overcome it. The third is ad literally over exposure to therapy. Rewrite your beliefs. Uh an example is at first you can say things to yourself like I feel anxious or if I feel anxious I will lose control. But through exposure therapy the thought then becomes I felt anxious but I handle this. And literally, you used to believe that certain thoughts and emotions totally controlled you. But through being constantly exposed to the reality of life, you're like, \"Wait a minute. I can handle this. I can do that.\" And you literally build conviction. The fourth step outside of building conviction is you build tolerance. And what it is is to feel uh different emotions, strong emotions without panicking. And what it is is you're relearning that discomfort isn't the same as danger. And now you're building an actual tolerance towards what's happening of what causes those thoughts and feelings. And the very last thing uh explosive therapy does is it changes the neuroplasticity of your brain. And what that is is the amydala that fires the fear signals start to slow down and calm down. and the uh prefrontal cortex, the front part of your brain that is in charge of reasoning and logic starts to be more active. So what it is is you start to fear less and reason more. Like your your brain totally thinks differently on different situations. And if you if I were to break all these five steps, I believe in what Jesus is doing and what he's doing right here in his speech is that he's making us more bold. He's making us courageous. He's helping our uh convictions get stronger. Um he's helping us get mentally stronger and he's trying to get our minds better. And you know, I think this is super important because Jesus constantly has people hating him, wanting to kill him, wanting to persecute him because of what he exposed within their hearts. And it's his words that do this. And we have the same message for other people. So I'm sure maybe you're thinking the same thing. What kind of hurts have I gone through? seeing my friends, seeing those close to me walk away from the faith. &gt;&gt; Going through immense trial where I'm I'm doubting if I even want to continue. Well, Jesus actually wants you to confront those thoughts rather than keep them hidden. But I want you guys to ask yourself certain questions. Are there parts of your walk with God or parts of the Bible that you specifically try to avoid? Are there are there certain people or certain kinds of advice that you don't want to hear at all? &gt;&gt; Is there anything relationally amongst other disciples that produces strong negative emotions or in general outside the church and how do you actually approach them if you start to feel those strong negative emotions? Are there topics in his word or the kingdom that almost feels like it's uh painful to think about? And I I think as you dwell on these different questions and you ask yourself, are there parts of my walk with God that I I put behind a wall and I allow no one to access? But the Bible says that all things are uncovered and laid bare for the eyes of him to whom he must give accounts. See, you either expose it now or he exposes it later. &gt;&gt; And you have that choice today. &gt;&gt; See, I think it's time for us to go through some spiritual exposure therapy. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to deal with the things that we find difficult. If you find it difficult to be open with other people, do it more. Find more people to be open with. If you find it difficult to fellowship and give more time to others around you, do it even more. So, if you find it difficult to share your faith, do it more. Whatever it is that you find it difficult to do in your walk with God, you have to expose it right now. &gt;&gt; It is no longer the time to hold those things in. What we're talking about, family, is longevity. &gt;&gt; We're talking about making it to the very end. Is that not why we're gathered here every single Sunday? So we can learn how to make it to the day that we die. &gt;&gt; It requires some spiritual exposure therapy. exposing it now before it's too late. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Luke chapter 12. &gt;&gt; And I want to break it down in in two ways. I think it's important uh to go through exposure therapy. And you see from the disciples example uh and what they said that Jesus, you have the words of eternal life. You see, he exposed what was in everyone's hearts. But the right response after everything is exposed is I have nowhere else to go. You're you're you're right, G. I I have a lot I have to deal with, &gt;&gt; but I'm staying right here with you. &gt;&gt; And that's why I believe Noah's communion was so powerful. It's just loyalty. &gt;&gt; It's just not giving up. You want to know how to make it to the very end. It's not about how many people you shared with, how many people you baptized. It's did you give up? &gt;&gt; That's what matters. In Luke 12, it says in verse 22, \"Then he said to his disciples, therefore I tell you, don't worry about your life, what you will eat, or about the body, what you will wear, for life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. Consider the ravens. They don't sow or reap. Uh they don't have a store or a barn, yet God feeds them. Aren't you worth much more than the birds? Can any of you add one moment to his lifespan by worrying?\" If then you're not able to do even a little thing, why worry about the rest? Consider how the wild flowers grow, they don't labor or spin uh or spin bread. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon and all his splendor will adorn like one of these. If that's how God clothe the grass, which is in the field today, and is thrown into the furnace tomorrow, how much more will he do for you, you of little faith? Don't strive for what you should eat or what you should drink or and don't be anxious for the gentile world eagerly seeks all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them. But seek his kingdom and these things will be provided for you. Don't be afraid little flock because your father delights to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Make money bags for yourself that won't grow old and inexhaustible treasure in heaven. Where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be. Also, point number one in talking about exposure therapy and what are you looking for is narrow your escape routes. You have to narrow your escape routes. You know, this passage talks about how easy it is to succumb to that fear, succumb to giving up. But there is one solution, and it is sheer loyalty. And it's saying, God, there is nowhere else for me to go. And I love the answer. It almost seems uh like it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. How is the solution to fear, the solution to worry is seeking the kingdom, seeking the body of Christ. How is that the solution? Well, what happens is you no longer focus on yourself. &gt;&gt; You're no longer thinking of your troubles and your worries. You're thinking of God, you you gave me this great kingdom. I want to put it first. You gave me this family. You gave me salvation. What more can I do but to give you all of myself in return? And you know, I think this passage uh is quite significant because towards the end it talks about where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. You know, and then I like this passage a little bit more than the Matthew chapter 6 passage because it doesn't even say seek first. It says deceit. That's it. Well, what what do you seek? It's not even like one, two, three, four. It's like just one. There is one thing that you seek. &gt;&gt; And u I I I find you know there are many things in today's world that people of course seek instead and that people treasure instead. And you know, we're going to do a tiny bit of uh I call this snippet Bible talk style. I I would love to hear what you guys think. What are things that people today treasure? What are some things? Yes. Family. People treasure family. Money. That's a huge one. Yes. People's opinions. Thank you. Material. Yes. Love. Relationships. Yeah. There's so many things. Yes. Possessions. Yes. Image. Right. There's so many things that people treasure and seek instead. Call us, you have something careers, right? There's so many things that we treasure and I find that whatever it is that we treasure, we invest accordingly. And I I I have some things I I want to share with uh us as a family. &gt;&gt; Last week, 29 disciples didn't give contributions. &gt;&gt; 29 disciples. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about a little bit less. I'm talking about zero. It is different. The number will be less if you even a penny, even a dollar. But 29 disciples decided to give nothing. I want you to think about that. Zero dollars. And you know, I I I think that sometimes we miss for different reasons. You know, we miss because sometimes it's a simple we forgot. You know, for me, forgetting is easy. So I put the zel transfer automatic because I I don't I don't I don't want to forget. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we miss because of financial hardships. And you know regardless you know Michael shared a very powerful point is that we do live in one of the wealthiest nations in the entire world. &gt;&gt; And I want you to think it cost it costed money to get here. It it for your meals this past week. It costed someone money whether you're on a government plan or anything. And so when you in that week, whether financial hardship or forgetfulness, didn't give, ask yourself, what did you invest in instead? &gt;&gt; Did you did you could have given $2 towards the church and it would have been totally different? I'm not asking about how much you're giving, but just giving in general. &gt;&gt; Do you see how important giving is in the Bible? And maybe instead of, you know, buying a $5 latte from Starbucks, you could have you could have put that in a contribution. Even if your pledge amount is 20 bucks, I'm not asking for it every single time. Hit that same amount, but give according to what you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to actually see how important it is to give the same way that God wants us to give. &gt;&gt; You know, my family at one point uh we had to have um three, four, at the most we had five disciples living with us growing up to help pay for our rent. And even still amongst that time, I remember a two or three month span where every day for dinner was rice, beans, and chicken. &gt;&gt; The classic meal. &gt;&gt; And and I I I remember those moments significantly because I I I I never saw my parents lose joy. I never saw my parents lose hope. And it really puts these scriptures in the into context, you know, uh when you look at what Michael was reading in 2 Corinthians chapter 8, this is how Jesus became poor so that we could become rich. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we want, you know, people to become rich and then we can become rich. &gt;&gt; But that's not what the Bible says. Amen. Like we have to actually look at it objectively. But then and at the same time, even Miss Pam shared that you give with no expectance of anything in return. And that's when God lifts you up. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to understand the full context of the Bible. You know, even coming to America when um Natalie and I lived in India for a year, you know, uh I think I've shared this before. The day that we were getting our keys to our new apartment was the same day that we were called to come back to America. And why is that significant? Because all the down payments you have to push for your apartment. So literally imagine, you know, when we days at what we could. We got a new apartment. Hey, do we have the keys? Actually, you're not going to live there. I'm like, could we get it back? No, you can't get it back. I said, what? And Natalie at this point is a few months along in her pregnancy. So, when we came to America, she was too far along and we had too little money to find a a health care plan that would support her birth. So, our little plan for uh her giving birth was going to the ER room and getting a checkup. And we actually had a plan because we didn't know, we had no prenatal care, no seeing like how well the baby is doing. We had none of that, right? And so, we just set a day and a time of when we're just going to go check. And so, we went in on a day to see like how everything is going. We just went to the hospital. Uh they just checked in and we went and we went to check and they said, \"Hey, like there are literally centimeters of amniotic fluid surrounding the baby, meaning that most of it left her body and that they had a um they had to induce her right at that moment. And so even though all of those financial struggles relying on the last minute, now we have our beautiful daughter Anna. &gt;&gt; And God really does fulfill his promises. He will take care of you. Even to the point where you're going at the last minute, at the last second, you have no other way to to provide for yourself. God know I will still take care of you. &gt;&gt; We have to see that his promises come true. What happens in chapter 3? You know, when life gets hard, do you do what matters most? And then which is the followup question of what matters most to you? When life gets hard, you will do what matters most. But is seeking his kingdom what matters most to you? in Habac or Habac, however you want to pronounce it. Chapter 3. I mean, before I actually, uh, later today when we do our leaders meeting back here at 3M, I'm actually I'm going to do a a lesson on the importance of giving. And we're I'm just we're going to look, you know, if you want to stay, you're more than welcome to, but I'm going to do a lesson on how does God truly view giving? How import Is it to him? Old and New Testament because God is the same as he's always been. The way we give might be different. I'm so glad we no longer have to go and find a lamb whenever we sin and go hunt it down. You know, I don't know anyone any uh your own sheep. I don't know. You know, then we have to go find it. You know, find a live one and find a good one. It can't just be any sheep. That be a really nice good one. Every time we sin and then sacrifice it. So, I'm glad the way that we do things is different, but God is the same. Amen. In Habacook chapter 3, in keeping with the first point, narrow your escape routes, says in verse 17, \"Though the fig tree does not bud, and there is no fruit on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though the flocks disappear from the pen, and there are no herds in the souls, yet I will celebrate in the Lord. I Rejoice in the God of my salvation. The Lord, the Lord, my Lord, is my strength. He makes my feet like those of a deer and enables me to walk on the mountain heights. You know what does it mean to narrow your escape route? That no matter how hard it gets, you always come back to God. No matter how difficult life may be, whatever temptation, whatever struggle, whatever thought that you might have that set yourself up against God, you always do the right thing. Why? Because you know that only with him does life reside. Only with him does freedom and redemption reside. And there's no other place you could go. And as Noah shared, your circumstances do not change. However, with God, you will have true peace &gt;&gt; because peace is not based off of your circumstance. &gt;&gt; It is not based on what is happening around you. It is not based on what is happening to you. It is not based on what is taken from you. It's not based on what you have. It is based on your condition with God. &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading. Let's go to Luke chapter 6. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 6. Look at our second point here. Second and final point Luke 6 and in verse 46 the Bible reads why do you call me Lord Lord and don't do the things I say I will show you what someone is like who comes to me hears my words and acts on them he is like a man building a house who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock when the flood came, the river crashed against their house and couldn't shake it because it was well built. But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built his house on the ground without a foundation. The river crashed against it and immediately it collapsed and the destruction of that house was grace. You know Jesus has this parable and in both examples of these two different people they both hear him. They both hear his words but only one of them actually acts upon us. See point number two is his words are your life. His words are your life. And I think it's super important that as we live our lives with God, once again, we're learning to take ourselves more and more out the picture and make our lives based on his word. How can I live according to what Jesus says? And you know, with these examples, one of them withstands the storm. They withstand the flood. And I think it's very significant that Jesus uses the term flood because the idea is that the water is above your head. and you feel like you're drowning. And I think many times people compare lack of self-control of your emotions as literally drowning. But when you have a wellbuilt foundation, a well-built house on the rock, &gt;&gt; then you can withstand any flood &gt;&gt; and that you're too high above water level for it to even begin to drown you. and that literally even though the waves crash against the foundation that it doesn't even shake because how well built uh it is on the foundation. You know, we're going to look at uh two passages I believe really challenge this concept of are we really standing on the rock and are his words really our life? Let's go to Luke 18. In Luke 18 verse 24 says to seeing that he became sad talking about the rich show ruler right before us. Jesus said how hard it is for one uh for oh I see how hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God. For it is easier for a camel to go to the eye of the needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. Those who heard this asked, \"Then who can be saved?\" He replied, \"What is impossible with man is possible with God?\" Then Peter said, \"Look, we have left what we had and followed you.\" And he said to them, \"Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left a house, wife or brothers or sisters, parents or children because of the kingdom of God, right? what we seek who we who will not receive many times more at this time and eternal life in the age to come. See Jesus constantly challenge what we find importance. Constantly exposes. If you find your house more valuable, your parents, your children, your family, then you are not worthy of me. Even as the scripture said earlier in Matthew chapter 5, but here he's talking lit, he's literally saying that if you could actually choose to forgo those things, then how much more will I actually give you? See, I of course I plan to bring Natalie and Anna along to uh heaven with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's not saying to literally forget them and and leave them behind, but it's asking you, what do you find more importance? How much more important is the kingdom than these things? And when it becomes that much more important, of course, you want to bring these people along with you. Amen. Because you realize, I never want them to experience life without this. I don't want them to have a life without the kingdom because it is so incredible. I'm going to bring them along with me. But at the same time, where do your loyalties lie? &gt;&gt; That's the point of this passage. Um there's another one in Luke 14. You know, we're going to uh renew our vows a little bit here. Luke 14 and verse 25. The Bible reads, \"Now great crowds were traveling with him.\" So we turned to them and said, once again, I love it. It's like the more people were around Jesus, the more he challenged them. He wanted to narrow the crowd. He wanted to see who would actually mean business. It says in verse 26, \"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. For which of you wanting to build a tower doesn't first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, after he has laid the foundation and cannot finish it, all the onlookers will begin to ridicule him, saying, \"This man started a build and wasn't able to finish. Or what king going to war against another king will not first sit down and decide if he's able with 10,000 to oppose the one who comes against him with 20,000? If not, while the other is still a far way off, he sends the delegation and ask for terms of peace. In the same way therefore every one of you who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be my disciple. See the salvation is free but following Jesus comes at a cost. &gt;&gt; And he c he wanted to re tell everybody this. Hey you might be around me all you crowds you want to hear my words. You want it here the life that I give that that I am a messenger coming from God. But yet at the same time if you choose to value anything above me you cannot follow. You have to renounce all your possessions. And this goes for everything man, woman, young, old, everybody who wants to follow him. And you know, I I really love this passage because even if you think it's like, well, you know, God, I do put, you know, my my my you above my family. I put you above, you know, my kids, you above, you know, my career, my education. But maybe there's a part of your life that you still don't want to expose to God. And then he kind of follows up at the very end that you don't forgo all your possessions. If you thought you can get it, whether it be one or two things, he doubled down to make sure you wouldn't think that you have to give up everything. You know, I I know for me, uh, similar to Noah, I studied the Bible when I was 13. Um, and after a year, uh, I realized that I just love my sin too much. You know, I watched pornography for the first time when I was eight years old. I got high for the first time at 12 years old. I've gotten into fights since elementary school. I've beat up kids just because I thought that I wanted to be better than them. I wanted to look cooler than them. I've stolen. I've lied. I've cheated. I I've tried to make myself, you know, be more proud by doing different things. But I realized that I was actually a completely weak man. And so, as the years went on, I started to get into drinking to to hide myself from who I truly was. And I I find that a lot of times my I try to live my walk with God hiding from those things, not wanting them to be exposed, but wanting them to stay separate, but God wants me to be to overcome these things. And in what way and and how does he want me to do that is to realize that, you know, I am nothing without him. And so therefore, everything I have is now his. All my heart, all of my life, when I when I sing to him, it is now completely his. But the desire to read my Bible that that's all completely his yet even till this day I find myself struggling with well you know maybe God if I hold back a little bit it might be a little God may maybe if I you know it's it's okay if I you know I I dial back in how much I read my Bible God maybe it's dial back in how much I give my heart you know because you know I'm I have to save my voice for preaching maybe you know God maybe it's okay if I share with less people I'm just being with you guys if I'm allowed to do that. &gt;&gt; But I want to share that there is no fruit in that. &gt;&gt; There is nothing that is produced in my walk with God with that. And I find the only thing that is produced is content. &gt;&gt; But what God wants us to do is to constantly give him everything. &gt;&gt; If you feel like right now there's things you don't want to give to God, expose it immediately. &gt;&gt; There are c parts of your walk with God that you're unwilling to change. Get open with somebody right now. &gt;&gt; Because if we're going to be in here for the long haul to make it into heaven to see the glory of Jesus one day, we have to expose it immediately &gt;&gt; and give him everything. Let's close out in First Peter chapter 1. You know, I think it's very important that we make these words our life because If we don't believe that every word in this Bible are the foundation of our life, we will find another foundation. It is so important when Jesus will keep asking you this. What are you looking for? Keep asking you this now. He's going to ask you this a week from now. You're going to be confronted with something, some trial, some hardship, and you're going to face that same question. What are you looking for? Why are you here? And I pray that through this lesson, we can answer it truthfully. And we'll close out with the answer in first Peter chapter one. It says in verse eight, though you have not seen him, you love him. Though not seeing him now, you believe in him and you rejoice with inexpressable and glorious joy because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls. Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that would come to you searched and carefully invested investigated. They inquired into what time or what circumstance the spirit of Christ was in them was indicating when he testified in advance to the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you. These things have now been announced to you through those who preach the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Angels long to catch a glimpse of these things. Therefore, with your minds ready for action, be sober minded and set your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. as obedient children. Do not be conformed to desires of your former ignorance. But as the one who called you is holy, you also are to be holy in all your conduct. For it is written, \"Be holy because I am holy.\" You may I mean we all fall into this category. None of us has physically seen Jesus walking around Jerusalem. None of us had the opportunity to sit down even preach before thousands and literally hear the the tone and the words from his voice, but yet we still love him. We still believe in him. And it says because of that faith, we have the salvation of our souls. And it talks about these prophets and it goes on a little snippet about h how the prophets, you know, they weren't able to experience this, but the spirit of Christ that dwelt within them told them that they were serving us. Literally, they didn't get to see what happened. They didn't get to see the triulation of the Bible to see what happens if people put the kingdom first. They just had one prophet and a lot of people having no idea what to do. But now we're at a day and age where we see it completely come into picture. We have all of the words of God right here. So why wouldn't we make it our life? They long to see a time when, you know, everyone would have the word of God. But now that time is here. So we have to make these words our life. And I love it because at the very end it literally says that because we have the his word with us because we have this great faith. It says therefore be ready for action. Once again putting that that faith into practice. Let it be proven true. And I find we have to ask ourselves this question. What are we truly looking for? And ask yourself why are you here today? Why do you come every Sunday? Why do you go, you know, you go every day of the week to your job, around your co-workers, maybe to your classmates, to your friends and your family. Why are you still here? But it is because of the grace and mercy of God. And I hope you're still seeking that today. That that journey never ends. That you know, the the idea of seeking God will continue to live in your hearts. and that you haven't decided to stop yet, but you decided to keep going. And let you know the grace and mercy and the reality that Jesus came here that we may have freedom and redemption continue to live within you. And there is no reason why we should not expose all we have to him &gt;&gt; because we have to keep pressing forward. &gt;&gt; If you feel like you're hiding something, there's emotions that you don't want to deal with, expose them and move forward. If there are parts of your walk with God that you find difficult to do, then start to do it. Strengthen your feeble knees and move forward. If you find it difficult to make the entire Bible the foundation of your life, grab someone next to you, get open, learn the scriptures, and then move forward. Because if we're going to get there, lap to the very end, we have to not give up. &gt;&gt; So, let us give God all that we have, and let us make God all that we're looking for. And to God be all the glory.",

    "book_reference": "Ezekiel 3-7",
    "series_number": 32,
    "transcript": "In second Timothy chapter 3, it says in verse 16, \"All scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting and training in righteousness, so the man of God may be complete equipped for every good work.\" You know this is written obviously from the perspective of written down scriptures and you know at this time what were the written scriptures? The old testaments. &gt;&gt; The old testaments. You know we're going to go into a study series of the book of Ezekiel right now &gt;&gt; and we're going to see how the Old Testament was written down in this way. It says for rebuking, for teaching and correcting and training in righteousness. where we're going to learn from the Old Testament how we can live righteous lives here in the new covenants. Um, but to look into uh what the book of Ezekiel is really about, let's get a head start here. Let's go to 2 Chronicles chapter 36. You have a good little bit of context to the book of Ezekiel. And I'm actually really excited to do this with everyone here um because I've been reading Ezekiel in my quiet times and I was just so impacted by it. I'm like there's so much richness in this book. We have to talk about it. Um so I have a plan where our plan is to go through the entire book of Ezekiel in about two months. So, what that requires is we're going to basically go over five to seven chapters every Sunday and we're going to break down a lot of the historical context. There'll be a lot of teaching. We're of course going to connect to it. Um because a prophet in the Old Testament is relatable because we've been given the Holy Spirit as we learned last Sunday that we are now prophets in the New Testament. Amen. In 2 Chronicles chapter 36, we'll get a bit of context in verse 15 says, \"But the Lord, the God of their ancestors, sent word against them,\" talking to the Israelites or specifically the southern kingdom of Judah, uh against them by the hand of his messengers, sending them time and time again. He for he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place, but they kept ridicuing God's messengers. despising his words and scoffing at his prophets until the Lord's wrath was so stirred up against his people that there was no remedy. So he brought up against them the king of the Chaldans who killed their fit young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary. He had no pity on the young man or young woman, elderly or age. He handed them all over to him. He took everything to Babylon. All the articles of God's temple, large and small, the treasures of the Lord's temple and the treasures of the king and his officials. The Chaldans burned God's temple. They tore down Jerusalem's walls, burned all his palaces, and destroyed all its valuable articles. He deported those who escaped from the swords of Babylon. And they became servants to him and his sons until the rise of the Persian kingdom. This fulfilled the word of the Lord through uh Jeremiah. And the land enjoyed its Sabbath rest all the days of the desolation until 70 years were fulfilled. So we get a a great picture here. God had his people enslaved in Egypt. He brought them into the promised land after wandering in the wilderness for 40 years. But we see after Joshua with the Israelites conquered the promised land, you had the time of judges where these people were running amongst themselves with no leader. So God would send periodic leaders called judges to help support them. Every time a leader died, they went right back into sin. And so what they wanted to do was be have a king just like the other nations surrounding them. So they had three kings very specifically united. They had first Saul, then they had David, and then they had his son Solomon. But after Solomon, his son Rayoboam didn't do a very good job, and the kingdom split in half. And that is when it all went completely downhill. And it's quite incredible because it built up and up and up their sin to a point where God says that there was no remedy. There was no remedy. literally he looked at his people and said nothing is going to help them. I tried time and time and time again and yet they do not listen. So what it describes here is uh says to the prophet of Jeremiah towards the very end there um that there is a 70-year prophecy of God saying I'm going to put some of you in exile. The rest of you will die by the sword meaning by battle. The Chaldans means the Babylonians would come in and wipe you guys out. Some of you guys will die by famine, meaning you will starve to death. Some of you guys will die by the plague. And it's this horrendous thing that's happening. But why? Because there is no remedy left for them. And I want to give us a few dates here. And I have a picture here if we could pull it up. Um do a bit of a teaching um almost like class style. So if you guys want to write them down, you can. uh if you don't want to that's totally fine as well. So we're reading the book of Ezekiel, right? But at this time, you know, we have Jeremiah who also prophet and up here Daniel who was a prophet and they all prophesied around the same time. It's kind of overlapping. But what we're going to learn here that there is three times that the Babylonians came and laid siege upon Jerusalem, the capital city. The first one was in 605. And we learned that in 605 that is when Daniel was originally taken. Um the second one was right here in 597. Um that is actually when uh sorry that's when Ezekiel was taken but Ezekiel didn't start his ministry until uh four years later. Um and then the last one was 586. So even though Ezekiel wasn't taken in the first one, he was taken in the second one. Um, but he didn't start prophesying until four years later. And Jerusalem wasn't destroyed until 11 years after it already happens. And we're going to learn all these dates. And if you want to know where you get these different dates from, uh, it's in 2 Kings chapter 24. I literally sat there for about an hour just making sure the math was correct before I pulled up a photo that wasn't even correct. And yeah, this is a totally correct image. And if you And if you want the image later, I can I can send in the group chat. I said in the group chat as well. Um, but the the theme and purpose of Ezekiel, you turn it off. Actually, let me keep it up there for a little bit in case they don't want looking at it. Um, but the theme and purpose of Ezekiel's book of his message was he was exposing uh the sins of God's people um and explaining why God was bringing judgment. And he was also very focused on the fact that because he was alive during the second exile before Jerusalem and all of Judea was totally destroyed 11 years later a lot of the people really believed that they would go back early that the 70 years wouldn't happen and that all these other prophets were saying that it was 70 years those were the false prophets and all the prophets saying that no it's only going to be a handful of years they believe that those were the right prophets. So a lot of focus was saying, \"No, you're thinking foolishly. You don't understand how severe your sin is.\" Um, but once the city actually fell in 586, then he shifts the purpose of this book to talk about God's promise of redemption. So it was all about God's judgment, his wrath, all that's going to happen. But once it's actually destroyed, he completely shifts focus. Uh, the name Ezekiel, it literally means God strengthens. And we learned that Ezekiel really was strengthened by God for the task. Let's go to Ezekiel chapter 3. We're going to pick up a little bit of um toward the end of where we left off last Sunday. We read um the majority of chapter 1 and two. So even though we're doing a bit of an introduction now, I didn't think of it till later that this could be a great idea. Um we're going to do the introduction but jump to after what we read from last Sunday. So in Ezekiel chapter 3, our title for us today is God always saves. God always saves. And in Ezekiel chapter 3, in verse four, the Bible reads um right after what we read last time about him receiving the scroll and it tasted as sweet as honey. In verse four of chapter 3, it says, \"Then he said to me, son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them, for you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or uh difficult language, but to the house of Israel, not to the many peoples of uh unintelligible speech or of a different language whose words you cannot understand. No doubt if I sent you to them, they would listen to you. But the house of Israel will not want to listen to you because they do not want to listen to me. For the whole house of Israel is hardheaded and hardhearted. Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Don't be afraid of them or discouraged by the look on their faces though they are a rebellious house. Point number one is God works through his messenger. You know the Israelites they were hardheaded and hardhearted toward God. But for to be a messenger of God's people God realized you know what if you're going to speak to them and even worse I know they're not going to listen to you. I'm going to make your heart your heart and your mind as hard as theirs. So in the way that they're rebellious against my ways, you're going to be rebellious against their ways. You're going to absolutely refuse to live the way that they want to live. And God literally says he's going to make uh his messengergers uh head and heart as hard as a diamond. I was looking up some facts about diamonds. You know, diamonds are found around 100 miles below the Earth's surface, right? And they form over literally tons of years. But the more significant facts about it is that it that close to the core of the Earth, it's around 2,000 degrees F. and that the amount of pressure that they get 100 miles below the surface is 7 u 725,000 pounds uh per square inch. So here's what that looks like, right? So an African elephant or let's say a Mazda CX-5, right? Weighs about uh 3,200 pounds, right? So uh the the uh area of a dime I look it up is about uh 38 inches, right, of an area. So the equivalent of 725,000 uh pounds per square inch is like 86 fullgrown African elephants standing on a dime. That's literally the amount of pressure that a diamond gets to be formed. Um and then they form with 2,000 degrees F. And there's a volcano that formed a few years ago in Iceland. And when it formed, it was hurling up like flaming rocks in the air because like obvious the ground cracked open. It was literally hurling up molten lava. And it was said that the rocks were about 2,000 degrees F. And that the neighboring town, every time a molted rock was launched in the air, you could feel it from 200 yards away. Like literally imagine being two football fields of distance away. And every time a rock is pulled up, you literally get a heat wave. That is how hot 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit is. And that a diamond is formed under that immense heat and under that immense pressure. And you know, God says to speak his words to those who won't listen, you need to have a a heart and a mind as hard as diamonds. And you know, I think it's quite interesting in Ezekiel chapter 3:10, what does that mean? It says, \"Next, he said to me, son of man, listen carefully uh to all my words that I speak to you and take them to heart.\" What does it mean to have a heart and a mind made of diamond with immense pressure and immense heat? You have to listen carefully to everything that God says. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 2 briefly. Hebrews chapter 2 in verse one a very similar passage it says for this reason we must pay attention all the more to what we have heard so that we will not drift away it's a very similar passage and I want to ask you guys are you drifting right now you know diamonds do not drift by pressure may harden under pressure. You know, uh is I want to ask you guys, does persecution make you drift or does it make you stronger? Does does people falling away, people stop studying the Bible, trials, things not going your way, or you know, whatever it is in your life and in your ministry, do they cause you to drift from God or does it make you even harder like a diamond? See, this is what it means to be made a messenger for God. What brings other people down literally makes us stronger as a disciple. And to do that, and how do we make sure we're not drifting and we're being hardened by all the trials that we undergo to be as strong a diamond is the strongest most dense natural sus sustenance on the earth. Literally, the way to cut another diamond is another diamond. That is how strong they are. And to do this, to not drift and be strengthened by the life that we have as a disciple, it means we have to listen carefully to God's word and always take it to hearts. And we have to pay attention all the more. And what that means is all as as days, as months, and as years go by in your disciplehip, ask yourself, are your quiet times getting better or are they getting worse? You know, when you're singing to God, are you singing with more of your hearts every Sunday or are you drawing your heart back because you've heard the song a few times now? &gt;&gt; Like literally, as time goes on, you only get closer to God. You only get stronger with God because he literally forming you into a diamond. And like a diamond every day under the pressure of this world, it only makes us stronger. And you know, I think it's important to think about, you know, that in order for us not to drift. You have to pay close attention to what God says. And if right now you feel like you're drifting, you know, ask somebody, bring someone next to you. Ask a brother, ask a sister, ask your disciples and say, \"Hey, uh, what can I do to not drift anymore? What are passages that you think that I need in my life to be as strong as a diamond?\" And like Ezekiel, we have to get our strength from God by paying close attention to his word. Let's go back to Ezekiel chapter 3. Ezekiel 3 in verse 14 the Bible reads the spirit lifted me up and took me away uh I left in bitterness and in an angry spirits and the Lord's hand was on me powerfully. I came to the exiles at Tel Aviv who were living in the Chibar Canal and I sat there among them stunned for seven days. You know it's quite incredible. Obviously, last Sunday we talked about this great vision that he saw. Then like God gave him a scroll. It was as sweet as honey. And then God, I'm gonna make you as strong as a diamond. And then, you know, the spirit puts him right back to where he was. And then he just sat there, just stunned, you know, and I think that happens very often in our times of God, you know, being stunned. But let's see what God said to him in verse 16. says, \"Now at the end of seven days, uh, the word of the Lord came to me. Son of man, I have made you a watchman over the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, give them a warning from me. If I say to you, the wicked person will surely die, but you do not warn him.\" You don't speak out um you don't speak out to warn him about this uh his wicked way in order to save his life. That wicked person will die for his iniquity. Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood. But if you warn a wicked person and he does not turn from his wickedness or uh or his wicked way, he will die for his iniquity, but you will have rescued yourself. You know, he sat there stunned when God gave him a message and God came up to him and said, \"What are you doing?\" Like don't you see if these people die they will still die according to their sin but you will be responsible for it. You know I I find this message uh really significant to think about uh because you know God gave him a vision. He gave him a message but yet he sat there immobilized stunned unable to speak to God's people. And then when God came to him, he says, \"No, when they die in their sin, that is actually your responsibility because I gave you my words. I gave you a mission.\" And you know, each one of us is a messenger to our own families, to our own communities, to our own apartment complexes, right? Um to our own grocery stores, you know, that we go to that we shop. You know, when you go to Aldi, I'm a big Aldi guy, you know, like we are messengers to our communities. And I believe we have to take it upon oursel to take personal responsibility. And you know, I I think that um uh Ezekiel, you know, uh we're going to as we go through this book, we're going to do our best to cover a lot of the main points from this book, but if I were to cover everything and go verse by verse, it would probably take a long time. And so, I'm going to do my best just to hit the main points. And if you feel like I missed something really powerful that I didn't quite share and it didn't quite make the cut, just share it with a person next to you. Amen. If you if you like, you know what, Malik, there's this really good point. I know you didn't add it in your lesson, just share it with someone next to you. Amen. Um that's so we can cover as much as we can. Um, in Ezekiel 4 up to verse 5, uh, chapter 5:4, um, there are literally four signs that God, uh, tells Ezekiel to do for his people. One of them, he tells literally him to make it's almost like a street performance. And he he makes these little um like figurines out of clay, right? It's supposed to represent Jerusalem and him laying siege. who's kind of like playing puppets in the street like God's going to like bring his wrath on you guys like like like you know having like a little uh little show right there, right? Um that's one. It's called the sign of the clay tablet. The second one is the sign of Ezekiel lying on a side. Literally God says you will lie on your side for the amount of days equal to the amount of years that the Israelites and uh the uh people of Judah will bear their iniquity. So he literally laid on his side for 390 days when and that it said that God tied him up and that his meal at those times uh which was the second sign is the sign of defiled bread and it was made of lentils and beans and and you know grain and whatnot. But why was the bread defiled was because God said to eat it over uh burn it over uh flaming human extrements. And then Ezekiel complains. He's like, \"God, I don't want to do that.\" He's like, \"Fine. You know, that's fine. Um, you have to eat it over burning cow extrements instead.\" &gt;&gt; And why was Ezekiel given this crazy task was to show what life was going to be like for all of the Israelites because of his wrath. It was an image of the wrath that God was going to bring on all the Israelites that literally they like their the seed. Do you guys know what a siege is exactly? Basically, there's a wall surrounding Jerusalem and they block all imports coming into the town. And so, literally the only food they have for the entire city is what is made in the city. But imagine trying to siege off New York City. Food's not being made in a great town. It's made outside of the town. So, it was literally made for them to starve to death. And so this example of him eating food over burning estrint is the example of what it will be like having no food. You are literally eating nothing but scraps. And it talks about even cannibalism happening during the siege as well. Um let's continue in Ezekiel 5:5. Uh and this is our second point. It is quite simply sin hurts God. Sin hurts God. In Ezekiel 5 verse 5, the Bible reads, \"This is what the Lord God says. I have set this Jerusalem in the center of the nations with countries all around her. She has rebelled against my ordinances with more wickedness than the nation and against my statutes more than the countries that surround her. For her people have rejected my ordinances and have not walked in my statutes. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says. Because you have been more subordinate than the nations around you. You have not walked in my statutes or kept my ordinances. You have not kept the ordinances of the nations around you. So in this example, literally the sin inside amongst God's people was worth worse than the nations around them. Literally imagine this. Imagine sin being worse in the church than it is outside the church. That is how bad the Israelites were doing. It was that wicked. Like God's like literally you couldn't be worse than the other nations who don't even have me. That is how bad the condition was of Israel. And all of chapter 4 up until this point literally God was giving Ezekiel commands showing and forelling the destruction about to happen in the third exile. Right? And but in chapter 5 verse 5-17 uh God talks to Ezekiel about what it all means. And in verse six it's quite incredible thing about the even concept that God's people were more wicked than those around them. And I was thinking about this conceptually you know as a church right and we aren't uh the only we aren't the only church of disciples but only disciples will be in this church. Amen. And it's understanding that like wow, like if we're want to be a part of this, we have to take personal responsibility of our own walks with God. &gt;&gt; Like we're not here just to show up on the Sunday, hear a great message. And then even though we walk out this building, we're still a part of God's church, then we act just like all the other people around us. We have to actually be disciples and walk like disciples. You know, ask yourself, why don't you drink? Why don't you go out and you go to clubs and parties with your other maybe friends outside the world, you know? Why don't you watch pornography like you used to? Like all these different things. And do you not do these things because you're around a group of people who vocalize it and you're only not doing it because you kind of people please them? No. We have to not do it because our own personal convictions with God. &gt;&gt; Like literally, imagine this. If all of this were to come down right now, if everyone were to move away, you were asked to move to another place, you were forced to another place, let's say war happened in America, what would you do with your walk with God? &gt;&gt; Would you still share your faith? &gt;&gt; Would you still have daily quiet times? &gt;&gt; Like, imagine if the worst case scenario were to happen, would you still follow the Bible? See, this is what it means to walk with God. Because even if you weren't part of this room, you know, there's about a hundred of us in here, sin still hurts God, no matter what group you're a part of. And it's important to take personal responsibility in our walk with God. You know, there's been times in my own walk with God when I've really questioned like what would I do if this all were to fall apart. You know, I I think about when I was in India on a for mission field, we were debating like literally like, you know, with all the situations happening to us out there like would I stay faithful if the worst thing were to happen. You know, a lot of us remember in October when the split happened. I remember exactly where I was when the split happened. I was I would head to ICCM and then there was there was a break and hey, we're going to hold off class for a little bit and talk about this. I remember thinking to myself, what would I do? What would I do? all were to fall apart. And I remember having to really dig in my Bible of what are convictions that are everlasting. &gt;&gt; Like what are the literally the truths of God of God's word whether I follow them or not? God's word is literally like gravity. You don't have to believe in it, but it's there and and I have to submit myself to it no matter what's going on around me. &gt;&gt; You know, I think that we have to make God's truths our own. It's not dependent on if other people are doing them. It's not dependent on if things are going bad or well. It's literally all about because it's the truth. I am going to follow it no matter what is happening. And you know, like I said, this is even recent for me trying to do my best to make sure no matter what happened around me, I'm still going to follow God's word. It is a lifelong journey. What you learn about even being a diamond and it talks about listening carefully to God's word, doing it all the more. It's all about not giving up. Like, how do you actually become a diamond? Is you taking God's word and even when it's hard, just tell yourself, I'm just not going to give up. I'm not going to stop. No matter how hard it gets, I'm always going to give God my heart. Let's go to Ezekiel chapter 6. In Ezekiel chapter 6 says in verse 9, \"Then your survivors survivors will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive. How I was crushed by their promiscuous hearts and that that turned away from me and by their eyes that lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves because of the evil things they did, their detestable actions of every kind. And they will know that I am the Lord. I did not threaten to bring this disaster on them without reason. You know, the Bible literally says that God was crushed by Israel's promiscuous hearts. Them going after idols, them going after false worship, doing sins worse than the nations around them. It said that God is crushed. And it's incredible to think that we are made in God's dish. like these emotions of, you know, I'm I feel depressed. I feel like nothing's going my way. God has felt those things and we're made in his image. But what's amazing is that in all of this, really, when God told Ezekiel they wouldn't listen to him and that God was crushed by their sins, the overall message that you get is God still sent. Think about that. God knew that they none of them listen to him. But he still sent them. Even though God was crushed, he was betrayed. Even before Jesus came to earth, he still sent a messenger to his people. That is how much God loves us. When he knows you're not going to obey, he still sends a messenger. Isn't that incredible how much God loves us? But since sin hurts God, we have to know that judgment is always obvious. You know, we can tell when we're in a slump. You know, we can try to convince ourselves that, you know, well, maybe it's not that bad. You know, like this is kind of going well. This is going pretty good. But if we're going to be honest with ourselves, we all know when we're in a spiritual spot like we know when things aren't going well. And it's our responsibility to take it upon oursel to once again tell those around us. Say, \"Hey, I'm struggling.\" Maybe I maybe if you do know it, tell them. If you don't know it, you know, say, you know, uh, submit yourself to being interviewed. Whatever it means, right? Like do whatever it takes to be close to God. Um, let's keep going to Ezekiel chapter 7. Point number three, altered truths are false doctrines. altered truth or false doctrine. We're the thing about doing expository preaching, uh, the message, the points themselves don't quite connect. We're just trying to draw from exactly what is being said to Ezekiel. So, in a topical study, it's all going to flow a little bit better, but here, we're just going to take and extract the information from it, even if it doesn't quite flow. So, if it's feeling a little like, you know, I'm not very used to this, just give me an amen. So, I kind of know I know you're still with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, but in Ezekiel chapter 6 up to chap the end of chapter 7, uh, Ezekiel prophesies very specifically against Israel's idolatry. And he announces once again this final destruction happening in 586 because it didn't quite happen yet. And you learn from how Ezekiel wrote the book that he he wasn't writing it after everything happened, but he would write it kind of as events are happening and as they're unfolding. So as you know, he was given a message, he would typic, you know, many commentators say that he would write a little bit. He would do whatever God told him to do and then an event would happen and then he would write some more. And so it was like other books were kind of compiled at the very end of the ministry. But this book, a lot of people believe it was kind of put together as time went on, which is really cool. Um, but as we know, he was taken in the second exile, but he's announcing the third destruction, which in that third destruction, very specifically, the temple was destroyed. Um, and the temple to the people of Israel was like literally imagine like your family is just wiped out. Like all that you loved and cherish is gone. In Ezekiel chapter 7, we'll get a picture of this. In verse 16, it says the survivors among them will escape. So, he's talking about who would survive and enter exile versus who would enter into destruction. Um, and we'll keep reading here. will escape and live on the mountain like doves of the valley. All of them will moan over his own iniquity. All their lands will become weak and all their knees will run with urine. They will put on sackcloth and will overwhelm them. Shame will cover all their faces and all their heads will be bald. You know, I think what's interesting before we move on is God is not afraid of us feeling shame. He's not afraid of us feeling shame if it leads to repentance. But I think the world is trying to teach us that if if anyone is making you feel any sort of negative emotion, you have to run. If anyone is giving you some sort of message, some sort of word, and it doesn't make you feel good, then it's not for you. But that is not what the Bible talks about. That if it makes you feel shame and guilt, and you have to cover your head with with, you know, ashes and dirt, you know, metaphorically speaking, the idea of like, you know, I am nothing but dirt. What have I done? That is good. if it leads you to repentance if it leads you to change. But let's keep reading uh in verse 19 says they will throw their silver into the street and their gold will seem like something filthy. Their silver and gold will be unable to save them in the day of the Lord's wrath. They will not satisfy their appetites. Uh for these were the stumbling blocks that brought about their iniquity. He appointed his beautiful ornaments for majesty, but they made them their detestable images from them, their abhorrent things. Therefore, I have made these into something filthy for them. I will hand these things over to foreigners as plunder, and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane them. I will turn my face from them. As they profane my treasured place, violent they will enter it and profane it. You know, it talks about another point how um they would throw their silver and their gold and treat them as dirt to treat them as filthy. And I want you to imagine this. If all that you love and cherish is taken away from you, whatever you have left, you consider nothing. You're like, I might have this house. I might have my career, but if all of a sudden my wife and daughter was taken from me, I would have nothing. That is what the Israel felt Israelites felt in this moment when Jerusalem specifically the temple was destroyed. And you know I think it's quite interesting the part that really me is verse 20 when it says that he appointed his beautiful ornament for majesty but they made them their detestable images. Literally God gave them instruments of worship and they took them, decorated how they liked and they worshiped them in their own way. And I believe this is an incredible symbol for how false doctrines are created now and every day. Uh like literally people take what God gives us and they reform it and then they now idolize their own version of it. You know, I like to think how people stand around signs saying repent or perish, which is in the Bible. It's in Luke chapter 13. But now they're screaming at people with zero love and zero actually way of helping them just saying, you know, you're going to hell. Somehow fix it, buddy. You know, and it's like they idolize this one part of the Bible, but they forget the idea about love about setting an example. You know, I find sometimes people they idolize another part of God's word. What is it? If you just believe in God, you'll be saved. You know, scatter in different parts of the Bible. But you know, then you go back and wait a minute now what about the repentance aspect? Well, what about disciplehip, right? I find sometimes people idolize the great commission even, right? What how do I idolize going and making disciples and people idolize baptism? And now they literally baptize babies because they say it's so important, right? But they're taking what God gives them and they decorate it in their own way and then they begin to idolize it. Um let's go to Colossians chapter 2. Colossians chapter 2 it says in verse four and then we'll jump to a different verse here. The same chapter says Paul writing. I am saying this to you that no one will deceive you with arguments that sound reasonable. You know, I think you have to be really careful because false doctrine sounds right. False doctrine, it sounds right. Why? Because once again, it's a a taking of what God has given us and decorating in a way that pleases the eye. And if you keep reading in verse 16, it says, \"Therefore, don't let anyone judge you in regard to food and drink or in the matter of festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of what was to come. The substance is Christ. Let no one condemn you by the delighting in aesthetic practices and the worship of angels claiming access to a visionary realm. Such people are inflated by empty notions of their unspiritual minds. He doesn't hold um onto the head from whom the whole body nourished and held together by its ligaments and the tendons grows with growth from God. If you died with Christ to the elements of this world, why do you live as if you still belong to the world? Why do you submit to regulation? Don't handle, don't taste, don't touch. All these regulations refer to what is destined to perish by being used up. They are human commands and doctrines. Although these have a reputation for wisdom by promoting self-made religion, false humility and severe treatment of the body, they are not of any value in curbing selfindulgence. You know, this passage is really incredible. And of course, Paul is speaking very specifically of uh of Jewish customs seeping into the church itself uh and certain practices. But I find in today's day and age in this culture maybe not with Judaism but with other practices of worldly practices other religious practices are trying to seek its way into God's kingdom. You know um you know I think the thing to look out for is it says in verse four that they are arguments that sound reasonable that they are elements of this world. Like it's like there's truth in it but there's elements that are aspects of the world. It says it has a reputation for wisdom. Meaning that it has a history of working. It has a history of actually doing some level of good. But what does it say? That is actually a self-made religion. It comes from false humility and that is actually a severe treatment of the body and that it has no value in curbing selfindulgence. At the very end of the day, what is false doctrine? Why is it false? It doesn't actually change your hearts. And it's really easy to weigh out false doctrine when you go through all the whatever you know what it's trying to preach to you, what it's saying to you, what it does to you in terms of does it actually keep you from sinning? Does it actually help you get closer to God? Even if you think about it, you know, the concept of believe in God and you'll be saved. Yeah, it sounds nice. But that's the issue with it. We don't just follow doctrines because it sounds nice. &gt;&gt; And you weigh against the scriptures. You're like, \"Wait a minute. God's message wasn't just a message that sounds pleasing to the ear. What actually convicts me?\" Right? And I want you guys to ask yourself, do you guys have practices in attempt of being spiritual, but actually make your walk with God worse? Are there things that you're doing believing that maybe it's good? It sounds kind of reasonable, but each and every day you're actually corroding your path with God. You know, I I know times in my life when I've done stuff similar. You know, there's been times when I'm sharing my faith, you know, rapidly going person by person, but really I'm not going in depth in the conversation, not because I'm trying to be spiritual and reach more people, but actually because I'm discouraged. You know, I'm I've been tired of facing rejection. So maybe if I just share with people in a fast way and not really connect with them and it sounds reasonable, but I'm doing it out of a discouraged and unfaithful heart, you know. Um, I remember uh funny story. Um, uh, Matt, uh, I lived in New York. Uh, in the time, um, I don't remember if it was before or during Nat and I's dating relationship, you know, I would go on these 6 a.m. prayer walks, but sometimes I would push myself to go on these prayer walks just to run into her. And and it was like like, oh, I'm just trying to be spiritual, you know, but like really I'm trying to like sneak in like a weevil time, you maybe I can like see her and say hi, you know, but like it seems reasonable. Maybe that one's a bit more, you know, innocent, I guess, you know. Um, but I remember another time, uh, there's a a disciple who just got baptized and I was trying to relate with him, you know, I was trying to find like, you know, how can we really connect and he mentioned that he likes, you know, New York drill rap and I'm like, well, you know, I used to listen to it a little bit and I actually played some music I used to used to listen to completely violating my conscience, knowing that I don't want to listen to this kind of music anymore. But I told myself, you know what? I want to relate to him. Let me just play just a few seconds of it anyways, even though it completely violated my conscience. And you know, I think it's very important that we have to, you know, really analyze our walk with God to see if we're idolizing parts of our walk with God when we're actually decorating his word a little bit to fit our own way, but it actually goes against the scriptures. It violates our conscience. And we have to be careful not to have practices or having false spiritual practices in attempt to be spiritual but actually making our walk with God worse. And once again the way you do that is you have to combat that with the truth of God's word. How do you do that is you have to be thorough in asking for advice. The Bible says with many adviserss victory is assured. And so when you're kind of wondering like I don't know is this is this leading me farther from God? getting me closer to God. Ask a brother around you. You kind of see my theme for this entire lesson is ask someone next to you, right? Because we have to do this together, right? Um let's close out here back in Ezekiel chapter 7. &gt;&gt; Thanks for bearing with me. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter 7. Uh in in verse 26, hey guys, it says uh disaster after disaster will come and there will be rumor after rumor. They will look for a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from the priests and counsel from the elders. The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed in grief, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their own conduct and I will judge them by their own standards. Then they will know that I am the Lord. You know, you will see a theme in the book of Ezekiel. Whenever God judged his people and cast on wrath, it was so that they would know that he is God. Whenever God would lift them up and cause redemption, it was so the surrounding nations would know that God is the Lord. So whenever you're actually undergoing trial and God is testing you, it is so that you can know that God is the Lord. Amen. And whenever you know things are going great in your life, it is so other people can know that God is the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, sin hurts God to a point where it literally says in St. 36 that there is no remedy. And it literally says here that we would that the people of Israel are judged by their own standards. You know, if I were to sit and write my own religion and come up with all the ways that I think I could pass judgment, you know, the Bible says that I would still fail. That I could never be as thorough to even pass my own test. And I think it's important that we don't actually force God because of our sin that God would judge us by our own standards. Um, and I'm really grateful and thanks be to God that we now have um not just messengers in our life, disciples who have come up to you even if there was no remedy, God still sent messengers to you. And I'm grateful that God still sees a way out even when there is no remedy. And believe this, a disciple of Jesus met you that brought you here today. Whether it was today, whether it's a few years ago, the reason why you are here is because God sent a messenger. And you know, of course, all of us here have one true messenger and that is Jesus Christ. And God and Jesus is always ready to save. Even when sin hurts God, God always sends a messenger. So, you know, let's remember this message to remember that the Lord will always be God. Whether it's a time of judgment or a time of redemption, no matter what is happening, if there is no remedy, there will always be a way out if you obey him and pay close attention to his word. God be",

It also stresses Ezekiel's role as a watchman, holding him responsible for warning the wicked, even if they don't listen, because their blood would be on his hands if he failed to speak God's message."

Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Proverbs 29. &gt;&gt; You know, when I was younger, I dreamed about being in the NBA. &gt;&gt; Well, let me rephrase that. When I was shorter, maybe that might be more helpful. When I was about half my height, &gt;&gt; I dreamed about being in the NBA. And many kids, they have dreams, you know, they dream, especially really big dreams. I want to be an astronaut, you know. I want to do I want to, you know, dig up dinosaurs. I want to be a dinosaur, baby. &gt;&gt; And they dream like these huge dreams, right? And I know for me, I wanted to be in the NBA. And as time uh progressed, you know, it starts off all your friends are really supportive. They're like, \"Yeah, like you can do it.\" And they always say, \"Remember me when you make it big.\" So that's what they always say, like, \"Don't forget about me.\" What they're really saying is like, \"Send me money when you're when when you're rich.\" That's what they're really saying. And but over time, all of that you can do and encouragement turns into negative disbelief of no, no, you can't make it. 04% of people who try actually make it into the NBA. You can never do this. And it was just you can't do it. Why would you say that? Just settle for less. You you could barely make it overseas if you wanted. And I'm like in middle school. And I find that over time um I've allowed a a lot of those uh negative that negative feedback to really influence how I view this. even to the point to where I really questioned if I really liked basketball anymore. And I allowed the the words of others uh of what they thought I could do to kill my own dream, &gt;&gt; to kill what I thought that I could do. And of course, we're going to focus not just on what do we want to accomplish for ourselves. I want to ask you is is the pursuit of God still your dream today? Is the pursuit of God still your dream? Meaning, you've made that decision before. But then maybe I have to ask you, have you ever made that decision &gt;&gt; to pursue God? In Proverbs 29, &gt;&gt; it says in verse 18, let me myself. It says without revelation people run wild but one who follows divine instruction will be happy. You know some translations say without vision or without prophecy it'll some translations say the people run wild as mine. Some will say uh the people um they they they perish. Um some actually say they cast off restraint &gt;&gt; meaning they they're literally like off to the wind do whatever they want. And the idea is without the word of God giving you hope in your life, &gt;&gt; you have no purpose &gt;&gt; and you realize that and you run and live life aimlessly, &gt;&gt; not knowing what to do. And I love that this passage is actually a reference to what happens in Exodus 32 when Moses goes to God on the mount on the mountain, Mount Horeb, comes down with the Ten Commandments and he sees all the Israelites as they're heading to the promised land partway there worshiping an idol when he was gone for 40 days. And it's crazy. You would think like what is the, you know, similar for today? If you went like a month, imagine, you know, you talk to a brother or sister, they miss their quiet time for a month and next thing you know, they're like a Hindu or something like that. Like literally the idea was that he was gone for 40 days and they're already giving into idol worship. &gt;&gt; It's all it took, 40 days. And why is that important is because while they were gone, they didn't hear the words of God. They the God's prophet was no longer speaking to them. They had to wait for him. And literally without hearing the hope from the word, we just do whatever we want. And hope is a funny thing. It literally means expectation. That's just quite literally what it means. It's it's an expectation. &gt;&gt; And I find that there are so many false doctrines that have been created from these false but seemingly spiritual expectations. You know, some people they expect this great power from God in the sense of, you know, they want to go up to somebody, pray over their foot, their foot is healed. I I'm going to hear your heal your broken femur. You know what? Look at me. I can speak in a language that you can't understand. No one can understand. It's just me and God. Why? Because like, God, I've been saved. Show me that I've been saved by giving me a physical example of power &gt;&gt; and no longer looking at the hope of the word. &gt;&gt; You know, some people they put the expectation on God that he the creator of the universe revolves around themselves &gt;&gt; that God, you know, is like the moon orbiting around them as they live life. &gt;&gt; And you know, they they sing these different songs. You know, um there's a song that I heard the other day and the very first line to this, it's a Christian song seemingly quote unquote. The very first line was, \"He's crazy about you.\" Talking about God. The very next line is, \"He can't live without you.\" &gt;&gt; Those are the very first two lines in this quote unquote Christian song that God cannot live without you. And it has almost a million views on YouTube. &gt;&gt; I believe 682,000 views on YouTube. &gt;&gt; And isn't isn't that crazy? But people, they want to hear that. Like God, my expectation for you is that you don't have any for me and that it's just about me and that's all it is, right? Um, you know, some expect God to serve them based off of their own obedience &gt;&gt; and their own sacrifice and their own servitude. And like, God, as long as I do this, I'm like putting you on a chain that you follow me around because look at my servitude. Look at my obedience. And it's like it was never about God to begin with, but all about what he can get to you. And I want ask I want you guys to ask yourself right now where is your hope? &gt;&gt; Where is your hope right now in this moment? Is it truly in God or some seemingly spiritual false hope that is in God? Let's go to Exodus chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Title for us today is true hope. &gt;&gt; We'll be talking about hope today. And in Exodus chapter 3 in verse one, it says, \"Meanwhile, Moses was shephering the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. Then the angel of the Lord appeared to him um in a flame of fire with within a bush. As Moses looked, he saw that the bush was on fire, but was not consumed.\" So Moses thought, I will I must go over there and look at this remarkable sights. Why isn't the bush burning up? When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from the bush. Moses, Moses, here I am, he answered. Do not come any closer, he said. Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. Then he continued, \"I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.\" Moses hid in his face because he was afraid to look at God. Point number one, true hope can't burn you. &gt;&gt; True hope can't burn you. And you know, up until this point, you know, Moses, he's here shephering. We kind of skipped a lot of his background. Moses was born as a hunted man. He was born in Egypt at a time when Pharaoh saw the Hebrews as a threat to his kingship. And so he went after killing all of the uh boys and men under a certain age. So literally the moment Moses was born, he was being hunted for his life. his family put him in a basket, put him down the river, and he was, you know, caught by one of Pharaoh's daughters, and he was raised, funny enough, in Pharaoh's households. And the Bible doesn't go into specific as to the thought behind, let me kill all these children, but if my daughter finds one, I'll raise them. Doesn't expand on that, but that's what happened. Amen. And then while all this happens, he he's raised um as a uh as an Egyptian in a sense under um the royalty of Pharaoh. But one day he sees another Egyptian man uh beating a Hebrew man because the Hebrews were slaves. And as he sees it, Moses goes up and it says that Moses strikes the Egyptian man dead. And you would think that the Hebrews would be grateful for him, but instead whenever they said when they saw him, they would be fearful saying, \"You won't hit us too, will you?\" And so in fear of his life from the Egyptians and then even from his fellow brothers and sisters of Hebrews, he runs the Midian. And so now he's in Midian. He gets married. He has a child. And we get to this point where he's shephering his flock. And I try to think, you know, what what might be going on in the mind of Moses at this time? He was hunted. He was hated. And I'm sure he might even be asking himself, who am I? Am I a Hebrew? Am I an Egyptian? Am I a Midianite? Like, you know, the the Hebrews, they don't like me. I was I've never grown up with them. The Egyptians I grew up with, but they also hate me. I just killed one of their men. Now I'm a Midianite. I just met these people, but now I'm married to one and you know I'm this is they actually love me the most. I have no idea who they are. So in a sense I can imagine him struggling with identity, who he truly is. And if I were to put myself in his shoes, probably feeling a little bit lost. Where do I belong? And amidst all that, he's shephering this flock. And it says that he sees a burning bush. And a bush is significant because it's like a small tree. And trees symbolize life. Think of all the psalms that talk about a tree. And it's supposed to be you looking at it in a self-reflective kind of sense, right? So the trees, they symbolize life, but also supposed to help you look inwards. Like who am I in comparison to this tree, right? Think of all the times that Jesus says like being fruitful. It talks about a tree planted by a stream. all talking about reflecting on inwards right on ourselves but then he sees it burning but it is not consumed and I I I think it's quite interesting to think about that because a fire should it should make this this tree like charcoal it should be burnt to a crisp but yet even though it was literally surrounded by fire it was unharmed unaffected it was it was unmoved it was literally unconssumed by this fire and I imagine Moses looking at this tiny little tree and looking at himself thinking like, \"Why can't I be unconsumed by this fire? Why can't I be like this? Surrounded by trial, by hatred, confusion, and yet unmoved by the fire that is surrounding me.\" And it's amazing because before God said a word, he used this image to give Moses hope of what life could be like with him. And God only spoke to Moses once he was amazed by it. Once Moses saw it, he went up. And it literally said that when the Lord saw Moses come up, he then said, \"Moses, Moses.\" You know, I I find it super significant because the bush is like God calling to him saying, \"Moses, this could be you.\" Surrounded by flames and fire yet unconsumed, unburnt. Why? Because of the hope that I am giving you. And you know, it's I find it super powerful. I think of for myself when I was playing basketball, when I started to like basketball less and less, I I literally would ask myself certain questions of do I even do I even want to play basketball? I've been doing this since I was younger. My family said I was uh taller than average, but do I actually want to play? And I would find myself at tournaments like actually hoping to leave like if I could just be picked up early and not play any more basketball. And uh I believe all of that happens like you know testing of what I really want to be. What is the dream that I had? I believe it was to lead me to this moment today to find my true hope in disciplehip. &gt;&gt; You know I I put it so much in whatever fame, fortune, title, status, whatever it could be. But God saved me from all that and gave me a true hope. And I I want you to think about this. If you feel like your hope right now in God is being burnt and you're being consumed in your walk with God, I have three questions I want you to ask yourself. &gt;&gt; The first one is, how much am I currently blaming people for my present situation? How much am I currently blaming people for my present situation? I find what happens very often whenever the topic is on your sin somehow it is brought up what other people are doing &gt;&gt; and it's like that's somehow a factor when you're standing before God and what he's going to judge you based off of. Do you bring other people into your walk with God when God is just looking at you? Second question I want you to ask yourself is, is my expectation in seeing God or seeing what God can do for me? You know, the Israelites, as I mentioned before in chapter 32 of Exodus, they were literally told to plunder the Egyptians when they left Egypt. God said, \"I'm going to give you this vast amount of gold and wealth and treasure.\" But when push came to shove, they had no more hope in God. They used what God gave them all this treasure and they worshiped an idol. Like literally, we can take the blessings that God gives us and worship it with idol worship. Take you know whatever. God can give you a family. God can give you friends. God can give you a great job, a great education, a great mind, a great way of thinking. And yet you can still idolize all of that. And yet somehow we think, well, God has given it to me. So it must be okay but it is wrong. The third question I want you to ask yourself is do I have a low tolerance for the flames? Do I have a low tolerance for the flames? And why I think this is probably one of the more important questions is because you know sometimes we um you know think of it this way if whatever is happening in your current situation whatever trial hardship suffering confusion whatever it may be it might stimulate something that happened to you in the past. So the current situation you might have actually matured to the point to understand what's happening but because it stimulates a past pain. You don't feel pain from the current situation but you bring into reality a past situation. And what happens is now we get mad at God, mad at other people, but really it's we never matured or learned from our past experiences. And it's like we might have evolved in some sense and we've gone through the same thing over and over and over again and instead of building up a tolerance, we just remember the past. You know, I like to think of it like horror movies. I hate horror movies personally. I'm not a fan. I can't stand them. I I hate being scarred. That's I I think I feel like people should share that sentiment, but some people don't, but I hate being scarred. I don't like it. Uh, but you know, I'm not going to test my horror tolerance by watching more horror movies. And I find, you know, God is, you know, funny enough, trying to refine us. Hey, here's the battle again. And we're like, nope, I am not watching that movie. I've already watched movies like it before. I don't want to get anywhere. If you tell me it's like a suspenseful thriller, that's just like code for it's a horror movie. Like, I'm just going to stay away from that. And we do that to God constantly. It's like God's like, \"Well, you don't even know. You haven't even washed it yet.\" You know, but but I guess what I'm trying to explain is that we use our past experiences determine how we're to go through our current ones. &gt;&gt; And what it means is that we have an extremely low tolerance. And so what so the flame actually may not be burning you, but you're you feel like it is because you haven't grown up. &gt;&gt; You haven't matured. You know, I I think right now as a church, it's either time for us to reassess our hope in God, see if we have a false hope, false expectation in God, or reestablish our past hope that we once had, &gt;&gt; bring back into reality the the true hope that God wants us to live in. Because true hope doesn't burn you. Let's keep reading in Exodus 3:7. It says, ' Then the Lord said, I have observed the misery of my people in Egypt and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors. I know about their sufferings, and I have come down to rescue them from the power of Egyptians, and to bring them from the land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey. The territory of the Canaanites, Heites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. So because the Israelites cry for help, has come to me, and I have also seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. Therefore, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you may lead my people and the Israelites out of Egypt. Point number two, last point. True hope lives out God's dream. &gt;&gt; True hope lives out God's dream. And let's ask yourself, why did God speak to Moses? And you can look at it from two different ways in terms of his qualities that God created Moses with. Because you see really later that Moses was very humble. He was the leader that you see in movies where it's like, \"Oh, I don't want to leave.\" It's like, \"That's exactly why you should leave.\" Like Moses was that guy. He was like, \"I don't know if I really want to do this.\" And God's like, \"That's why I picked you.\" You know? Um, so you kind from that sense, you can kind of from his character, okay, that's why God picked Moses. But then from God's point, his perspective of why did he come down in the first place? Why did he speak to Moses? Because he wanted to rescue his people. He saw how his people were being oppressed. They were suffering. And then finally after 400 years, they were crying out to God after being a slave for 400 years. And you know, God said to Moses, \"Come here. Take off your shoes. I got something I have for you to do.\" &gt;&gt; And think about all we talked about that Moses is going through. God doesn't even address this. doesn't even bring it to light. And I find sometimes we think to have a new hope, we have to somehow expand on our past one. But God is like, I'm going to get rid of it so much. So, I'm not even going to bring it up. &gt;&gt; I'm not even going to mention it because it is so horrific that all that needs to matter in your mind is this new hope that I'm giving you. &gt;&gt; It's the only thing he mentions the how much his people need him. What are you thinking about right now? Do you see how much the people in Tampa, the people on this planet need God? &gt;&gt; You know, God, he came to Moses and instantly took Moses's mind off of himself and then onto him and helping other people. And you know, I think it's interesting because there are so many, as I mentioned earlier, songs to where Christianity has turned into this selfcentered doctrine, this self-centered religion. I have some song lyrics I want to read for you guys. And uh we're going to hear how selfcentered the quote unquote Christian world is becoming. And I find that this is the harder part about it is that they're seemingly spiritual concepts. They're they're seemingly talking about some passage or some biblical reference, but we'll look at the dangers of emotionally tying yourself to them. Uh there's one that says uh you didn't want heaven without us, so Jesus, you brought heaven down. And it is somehow like implying that God's incomplete without us. Somehow implying that like literally God suffers if like we weren't alive. And when you hear these kinds of songs is like it's igniting this feeling that I'm so special. Like I am so much above other people like I have such great qualities. And instead of focusing on what you have to change is focusing on like how great you are right now. &gt;&gt; And but it seems you know technically fine in the moment. Uh, there's another one. This one's really hard to say. I'm not even sure why this is even in a song. Um, I'm gonna literally say it and you're probably gonna laugh, but it says, \"Heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss.\" &gt;&gt; Help me understand that there, you know, many people that dislike these kinds of songs, this kind of music, they call this kind of music Jesus is my boyfriend music. And it's it's like this concept of like you take like this sensual R&amp;B music and then just switch out some of the lyrics and and make it like sound spiritual. And so it's kind of like well I don't listen that kind of music. I listen to this music and you're like this is terrible. Like this this is not much better. This is this is terrible. Um but it's in reality it's it's irreverence you know. It's like what are you talking about? Like like a sloppy wet kiss. Why is it even on your mind? You know. Um but there there's other passages uh other song lyrics. One says uh there is no sin you won't forgive, no lie you won't believe. And once again the idea is that with all the the instruments happening, the guitar, the bass, the piano, the drums, it's it's it's igniting this emotion. I actually have a very close friend. atheist and he mentioned that like he we sat down and have done like Bible studies looking at scriptures and he went to a church service with other friends and they had music playing a piano going and he described it as a guy was up there like he called it smooth talking like talking really gently calling people to come down and get baptized and he had no belief in God whatsoever and he he told him I remember being at this service like almost standing up and going down and getting baptized. And it's almost like this interesting thing of like you it's this feeling that ignites you like overcomes all logic and all common sense and all biblical truth of just doing whatever is happening in the song. &gt;&gt; And so you hear a lyric like this, there's no sin you won't forgive, no lie you won't believe. And it's like God like you love me how I am. I don't have to change. And it's not like in the lyrics themselves that is like just the issue, but in the song overall and it's play on your emotions trying to get you to do something that is not true. Uh there's a few more. There's you took the fall and thought of me above all. That's I can't even grasp why that would be in someone's head because it's like God died for God can't grasp it either. Um, and it's like Jesus died for our sins. And somehow in this song lyric, you're thinking to yourself, he died for everyone's sins, but he was thinking of me first. &gt;&gt; And it's like, you know, you're sitting here in the song. It's like, you know, it's like he was Jesus thought of like Rod first. Jesus thought of like Casey first. It's like I was the first person on Jesus's mind, you know, and it's like it's igniting of this wicked emotions and even like you know Luna was talking about I think it's super true of being led by those things into darkness and you know there's this concept also they they call it um that God is like your cosmic butler &gt;&gt; like he's there to serve you and it's not like they say it but it's obvious in how they talk about Like it's like God waiter. You know my my my next order of blessings please. You know it's like that's how people treat God. And another way people talk about him is it's called you can look it up. It's called uh therapeutic dism. You should do a study on this therapeutic dism. And it's some it's literally using God as like your personal therapist. And it's like, you know, you have to now like you you go to God and you talk to him and he's like, \"Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's rough. Well, hey, come next time. Read your Bible again. And if you die, you'll get to heaven. It's okay with that.\" Instead of like, \"What is wrong with you? You have to change. You have to repent. You be different. Be holy as I, your heavenly father, am holy.\" &gt;&gt; They totally skip this. But the song is it's all about them. And Moses actually goes into this world of being self-centered. Let's look at an example a little bit in chapter 3 vers 11 and then we'll see how God responds. So after God said all this about I'm sending you to rescue his people and literally God's like I've chosen you. I'm sending you my people are oppressed and he's like yeah yeah God but like let's let's talk about me for a sec. In verse 11, he says, \"But Moses asked God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?\" It's literally it's I find sometimes we say things to God that is kind of implying that God is making a mistake. He's saying, \"God, who am I?\" As if God doesn't already know who you are. He doesn't already know why he chose you. But then it's like, God, like you have the wrong guy. You're God, you are wrong. And it's he's not maybe thinking it, but it's implied. Going back to this concept of when you're led emotionally, you develop these false beliefs and they jeopardize your faith. In chapter 4:1, Moses answered, \"What if they don't they won't believe me and will not obey me, but say the Lord did not appear to you?\" Is you think God didn't think of that already? you know, like God God knows what's going to happen or all possible situations. And even I find what's interesting is he's putting his expectation on the outcome of the commands. But God is just saying, \"Obey my commands.\" It's not your duty to worry about the outcome. It is your duty to obey me. And once again, his hope is on something that is false. It's an expectation of a good outcome. Being self-centered. He says in chapter 4:10, but Moses replied to the Lord, \"Please Lord, I have never been eloquent either in the past or recently since you have been speaking to your servant because my mouth and my tongue are sluggish.\" You know, I I find he's like, \"God, I'm I'm I'm an introvert. God, I'm I'm antisocial. I can't do it.\" And God already thought of that. And it's even funny enough, he actually gave him an answer. I'm going to give you Aaron, which is an even cool uh I guess foreshadow of Jesus sending people out two by two and how you know you might feel a certain way, but if there's two of you, you're going to be both. And even if you don't like it, there's still going to be two of you anyway, and you're going to go anyways. And he closes out uh Moses's last thought in verse 13 saying, Moses said, \"Please, Lord, send someone else.\" He just said, \"God, like, okay, I ran out of excuses. You're right. I just don't want to go. You got you got me. And you know is once again God doesn't even let that be an answer. &gt;&gt; He just says I'm giving you Moses. I'm giving you miracles. You're going to go anyways. &gt;&gt; You know, I find that hope in God and in God's commandments is like gravity. It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not. Like it's going to happen and and it's real and it exists. You know, God Jesus literally says that he could raise out out of stones sons of Abraham and that like he's choosing us, but if we don't allow oursel to walk in the light and be with God and in communion with the hope that he has for all of mankind, he's going to choose someone else. &gt;&gt; But he chose us. I like to think about that. That he did come to us. He did think of us, but we can still in turn reject him and be rejected by him. But then because of false expectations and false hope, we somehow try to live in these false this false reality that we set up from wrong convictions. You know, God wants all souls in this world to be saved. &gt;&gt; Every single last soul. &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe me, I have some scriptures. Second Peter chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter 3. We're going to flip through a few different scriptures here. In verse 9, it says, \"The Lord does not delay his promise as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance.\" God wants all to come to repentance. But that repentance is a true repentance. It doesn't just mean everyone who thinks about God once a day is going to heaven. No, but he does want everyone to come to heaven, but through his way, not your way. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Titus chapter 2. &gt;&gt; In verse 11, it says, \"For the grace of God has appeared.\" Titus 2:1, \"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people.\" Once again, God's message for everyone to be saved is for everyone. He wants the world to be saved. We're going to keep jumping through here. If you don't want to keep turning, you can just write down. Let's go to 1 Timothy 2. I have four more for us. &gt;&gt; 1 Timothy chapter 2 or sorry, chapter 4. We'll go to you later. Chapter 4 and verse 10. It says, \"For this reason, we labor and strive because we have put our hope in the living God who is a savior of all people, especially of those who believe.\" Once again, God is here to save all of mankind's and we put our hope in that. &gt;&gt; Let's go to first Timothy chapter 2, a few chapters before and verse three. It says, \"This is good and it pleases God our savior who wants everyone to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.\" Now, you have truth tied in with salvation. like he's not just like saved because of you know your once off belief but do you know the truth? &gt;&gt; Let's go to Old Testament Ezekiel 18. &gt;&gt; You know in the passage that talks about you know the the father uh gets the punishment for his own sins and the son doesn't take on the sins of the father nor vice versa. You know, God in this passage keeps talking about punishment and suffering for sins, but he throws in there another good scripture in Ezekiel 18 verse 23 in the midst of this whole chapter. It's a very good chapter. Um says, \"Do I take pleasure in the death of the wicked?\" This is the declaration of the Lord. Instead, don't I take pleasure when he turns from his ways and lives? You know, I people want to believe that. Well, God, how could God exist when he allows other people to go to heaven? It's like God doesn't I'm sorry, he when he allows other people to go to hell. God doesn't want them to go to hell. He wants them to be with him. &gt;&gt; He wants them to repent. And them doing what they're doing, that is their decision. He wants them to be with him. Last scripture that we'll look at for this idea in Isaiah 45. Isaiah 45 and verse 22, turn to me and be saved all the ends of the earth. For I am God and there is no other. And if you didn't believe it before, I hope you believe it now. God wants all people to be saved. &gt;&gt; Let's close out in 2 Corinthians chapter 4. 2 Corinthians chapter 4 says in verse 10, \"We always carry the death of Jesus in our body so the life of Jesus may also be displayed in our body. For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus's sake, so that Jesus' life may also be displayed in our mortal flesh. So then, death is at work in us, but life in you. And since we have the same spirit of faith, in keeping with what is written, I believed, therefore I spoke, we also believe and therefore speak. For we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you. Indeed, everything is for your benefit so that as grace extends through more and more people, it may cause thanksgiving to increase to the glory of God. Therefore, we do not give up. Even though our outer person is being destroyed, our inner person is being renewed day by day. For our momentary light affliction is producing for us an absolutely incomparable eternal weight of glory. So we do not focus on what is seen but what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal. You know this passage is incredible. You know, Paul is talking about this great glory that happens when you focus on what is unseen. When you put your hope in God and you go through whatever trial and whatever affliction and you can go through it because you won't be burnt up by it. Even though outside they might be attacking you, inwardly you are growing. You are thriving. Why? Because you are with God. And I have to think, no, my hope in God must transcend my own affliction. My hope in God must transcend what I physically see. My hope in God must transcend my flesh, my sinful desires so that my hope in God will transform my death. And that is why I hold on to hope. And there is no better time than now for all of us to press forward. And that because God, he cannot stand seeing people oppressed. He cannot stand seeing false doctrine spread around like gangarine. And he has chosen us to set people free. And you know, some people may not believe. You might face a hundred, 200, a thousand nos before someone finally says, \"Okay, I'll do it. Stop talking. I'll be in a Bible study.\" &gt;&gt; But that's not what's important. that God has already commissioned us. &gt;&gt; He already believes that we can do it or we wouldn't be sitting here right now. And I want you guys to see it for yourselves that you will not be burnt up if you put your hope in God. It is an everlasting hope that even whatever happens outwardly to you, you will last forever with God. And I love it being here a part of this kingdom, being in this room because you get a little glimpse of heaven. &gt;&gt; And then God is not just the God of the dead. If we die, we're in heaven. He's the God of the living. &gt;&gt; That my life right now is amazing being in his kingdom. &gt;&gt; And so, let us reestablish or let us reassess the hope that we have to align with the true hope that God wants us to have so we can live out God's vision for the world, the God of the world.",

    "summary": "The sermon \"True Hope\" by Malik Speckman explores the nature of genuine hope, urging listeners to make the pursuit of God their ultimate dream, in contrast to earthly desires or self-centered spiritual expectations. He uses the story of Moses and the burning bush to illustrate that true hope in God allows one to endure trials and suffering without being consumed. The sermon challenges listeners to move beyond self-focused faith and actively live out God's dream of global salvation, emphasizing that God desires all people to come to repentance and truth. Ultimately, it calls for a reestablishment of hope in God, focusing on the eternal rather than temporary afflictions.",

        "verse": "Proverbs 29:18",
        "insight": "The speaker explains this verse (often translated as 'without vision, the people perish') to mean that without God's word providing hope and purpose, people live aimlessly, casting off restraint. He references Exodus 32, where the Israelites quickly resorted to idol worship in Moses' absence, illustrating how a lack of God's direct word leads to spiritual wandering."
      },
      {
        "verse": "Exodus 3:1-6",
        "insight": "This passage, featuring the burning bush, is interpreted as a symbolic representation of true hope. The bush, representing life, is surrounded by fire (trials, hatred, confusion) yet remains unconsumed, signifying that with God, one can endure immense difficulties without being 'burnt up.' God uses this image to instill hope in Moses before speaking His direct command."

      {
        "verse": "Exodus 3:7-13",
        "insight": "These verses, combined with Moses' subsequent excuses in Exodus 4, illustrate how God shifts Moses' focus from his personal struggles and self-perception to God's dream of rescuing His people. The speaker highlights Moses' self-centered questions ('Who am I?', 'What if they won't believe me?', 'I am not eloquent') as examples of false hope tied to personal outcomes rather than simple obedience to God's commission."

        "verse": "2 Corinthians 4:10-18",
        "insight": "The speaker concludes the sermon with this passage, emphasizing that true hope in God allows believers to withstand external suffering and 'death' because their inner person is being renewed daily. It encourages focusing on the unseen, eternal glory rather than temporary, light afflictions, affirming that hope in God transcends physical sight, flesh, and even death itself."

        "insight": "This verse, along with Titus 2:11, 1 Timothy 4:10, 1 Timothy 2:3, Ezekiel 18:23, and Isaiah 45:22, is presented to demonstrate God's profound desire for all people to be saved. The speaker emphasizes that God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish but all to come to true repentance, refuting the idea of a God who is pleased with destruction or who desires people to go to hell."

    "transcript": "John in verse one it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. He was with God in the beginning. All things were created through him and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. In him was life and that life was the light of men. That light shines in the darkness and yet the darkness did not overcome it. Jump to verse 10. He was in the world and the world was created through him and yet the world did not receive him. He came to his own and his own people did not recognize him. This is talking about Jesus. And I love the perspective that it's coming from. It's coming from John the Apostle. And John the Apostle was the last living known witness to Jesus Christ that wrote about his testimony. So from this perspective written in about 60 to 90 AD which was 30 to 60 years after Jesus already died is coming from the perspective opening his book of how Jesus came to be why was he here why did he come down to earth and I love how he starts to that Jesus is God's word and he has always been with God and in him in Jesus are of course then the words of life. And it says that that life is the light to all of mankind's. A light that no darkness can overcome. And it says that this light that brings light to all of mankind came down to earth. He lived amongst us. And he came specifically to everything that literally was created through him. So it's like he came down. It's like these are my people. I love them. I cherish them. But then it says that he was not recognized and he was not received. You know, another way you could put it is that he was unnoticed and unwelcomed like like a a package received to the wrong address. He was rejected and returned. And that was how he was treated when he came down to earth by his own people. Let's go to Isaiah 53. In Isaiah 53, you know, Isaiah's quite incredible book, there's so many references to Jesus and prophecies about him that they're they're so specific in nature that when some people are quizzed on their Bible knowledge and they'll quote Isaiah, some people believe this a book in the New Testament because of how specific it is about Jesus. There is a man he went around uh Jerusalem uh about a few years ago until modern day and age and he would read parts of Isaiah and ask you know Jews which part of the Bible is this and they all thought New Testament. That is how specific it is talking about Jesus. And even those who don't believe in him can't refuse that it's talking about him and they're caught off guard when they're told that it was in the Old Testament. Isaiah 53 in verse one it says, \"Who has believed and what have we heard? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? He grew up before him like a young plant and like a root out of dry ground. He didn't have an impressive form or majesty that we should look at him. No appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men. A man of suffering who knew what sickness was. He was like someone people turned away from. He was despised and we didn't value him. Same thing. And this was 700 years before Jesus was ever born. And it talks about the arm of the Lord. Who recognized him? Who would know about him? And it literally says that he grew up that he was unimpressive when he was here on earth. He was not majestic and he had no significant appearance that he was desirable. Meaning, you know, when God came in the flesh, he wasn't, you know, some supermodel coming down, everyone look at me. He was just your average guy. And he he wasn't someone that anyone would particularly take notice of physically, but it says that he was rejected. He was turned down by mankind. And yet even though he was despised, rejected, said to he he was familiar with suffering, it literally said that people would turn their faces from him. They would hide their faces from him. I'm sure maybe if you guys have ever gone to the same spots to go share your faith, maybe some people might recognize you and they look at you and they're like, \"Oh, like you know, go across the street.\" That's happened to me a few times. But that was Jesus's constant life. people saw him like, \"Oh, I don't want to, you know, confront that guy. I don't want to be near him.\" And you see from 700 years before Jesus was ever born up until the point of the very last eyewitness of Jesus, it talks about how vividly he would be treated, how much how much people hated him, and how much they despised him. And before we start to relate oursel to Jesus's suffering, let's put oursel in the shoes of the people who are making him suffer. Let's put oursel in the shoes of those who put him on the cross. How we rejected him. And this it says at the very end of verse three, he says we didn't value him. Coming from someone who lived 700 years before he was ever born. So let's put ourselves in those shoes. Has anyone ever here been bullied before? Okay, so this might be a a tougher question. Has anyone here ever done the bullying before? Yeah. Okay, we all relate a little bit. Um, there is a I would say I've been on both receiving ends uh receiving and the one doing the bullying. When I was in middle school up until my freshman year of high school, uh, there is a time when I would be called like derogatory names and whatnot. Um, I would go, this is actually, it's very true. I have very vivid memories of this when, you know, people be playing basketball during lunch and I would come up and they would do one of two things. They would either hold the basketball until I left or they would move to a different court. Um, it was is I can tell the story later, but it was it was not fun. Um, and I remember I had dreams to like be in the NBA and then when I was younger and I literally had like friends like, \"No, you can never do it. Why would you ever dream that?\" And it's like, don't you like want me too? Like, wouldn't that be awesome for you, too? Like, if you if you supported me and then I made it, but they like they just didn't want it. And when I was even younger in the sixth grade, uh there was uh a guy, his name his name was Kobe, and I really wanted to impress him for some reason. And I thought he was really cool or whatnot. And there's a time when he wanted to borrow one of my video games that I had since the third grade, and I never got it back. and I've literally had that game for three years. I love that game. I don't I have no idea where it is now, but I I never saw it again. Um but on the same end, I've also done the bullying before around that same time in the sixth grade. And there was um you know, another kid and our school, they accepted food stamps to get free food in the lunch cafeteria. And I would ask this kid, \"Hey, like if you just go in, sneak food, like grab an extra burger and put it under your tray and like get it get it for me.\" I'm really hungry. And I would do it time and time again. And I had a friend named Vincent. And one day, Vincent came up to me. He's like, \"My bullet.\" I was like, \"What? A bullet?\" He's like, \"Yeah, bro. You're you're you're making him get your food. Have you ever asked him like if he even wants to do that?\" And I was saying, \"Well, you know, like I'm hungry. He gets it for free. no one's getting in trouble and I'm making all these different excuses. He's like, really? You are pressuring him to steal food for you. I was like, \"Oh, I did not view it that way.\" And from the moment he told me that, I never asked I never asked him again to get me food. But I I was thinking about that and how often like we can do the bullying or we can do harm and not even realize what we're doing. Wow. And I think of how much we might even do that to Jesus. Wow. The amount of people that do him harm, that reject him, but inwardly they're like, \"Well, everyone else is doing it.\" Think of the time that he was walking earth. You have the Pharisees, the scribes, the teachers, those who knew the Bible the most saying, \"Deny this guy.\" So, I'm not doing anything wrong by rejecting him. Everyone else is doing it. And I find it's the same thing today. You know, God says that, you know, if you refuse to obey the truth, he sends you a powerful delusion. But the first step is you refuse to obey the truth. So for me, it wasn't just that like, oh, like I'm I'm making all these different excuses. I just refuse to see that I'm literally making him steal food. And we do it to Christ all the time in how we treat him. And I find that for us after being confronted by the truth, we many of us have decided to repent, to change, to be different, that we heard how we're what we're doing and we're like, I'm done with that. I don't want to do that anymore. I didn't thank you for telling me the truth. But there are still those who refuse to believe. And I think about it and how they set themselves up not just against Christ, but against his people. So Christ is being rejected, being hated, being hunted down, but so are those who are following him. And it's not just by physical people, but it's a spiritual war. The the biggest perpetrator is Satan, the one coming against Christ, who he is, and who we are as well. But I like to think, why? Why would God allow such an enemy to constantly be against his son? Constantly be against, you know, him literally coming down the flesh and in turn being against us. If you keep reading in Isaiah 53, it has the answer. In verse 10, it says, \"Yet the Lord was pleased to crush him severely. When you make him a guilt offering, he will see his seed. He will prolong his days. And by his hand, the Lord's pleasure will be accomplished. After his anguish, he will see light and be satisfied. By his knowledge, my righteous servants will justify many, and he will carry their iniquities. Therefore, I will give him the many as a portion, and he will receive the mighty as spoil because he willingly submitted to death. And he was counted among the rebels, and he bore the sin of many and interceded for the rebels. You know, I really love this passage. And it says in the beginning that God was actually pleased to crush to crush Jesus severely. Wow. All that he went through, all that he had to undergo when we from the time of it being prophesied 700 years before he was born up until the time of the very last eyewitness saying the exact same thing. God all planned for that to happen. In fact, he wanted it to happen. And it says that after his anguish, after Jesus anguish that he will see lights. I love it because some translations literally saying that he will omit lights like lights will be coming from him and that he will be satisfied and that by his knowledge so that he will justify the many and carry their iniquities. You know, I like to imagine you're playing around with your siblings. You know, your parents are out and then maybe, you know, you somehow accidentally, you know, crush a window, a baseball or something goes right through the window and, you know, there's no way to fix that before they I have a really funny story actually of I don't know how somehow me, my friend, and I put a hole in the wall and then we like we got plastered, we got a piece of paper, we like we like covered it super fast before his family came back. But you know because you know what happens when you come when they come back is you get in trouble. But you know imagine this the the you know your mom or dad comes back they see the broken window. They see the broken base and you're about ready to confess everything. But then your older sibling says no I did it. And he takes all the blame. It's not their fault. It's my fault. I destroyed it. And you know it's funny because And and you even see it in movies sometimes and sometimes the parents they look at that and like I know you didn't do it. I know they did it. But seeing your guys' unity makes me proud. You're both off the hook. I find it's the same with you. It literally says that he justifies us and he carries our iniquities. And because of that God gave him the many like God gave him an an incredible people to be one with him because of his obedience. and even further so that he willingly submitted up until death. So God gave him a great reward. And though he was like us and we rejected him and all of this was a part of God's plan for redemption, you know, Jesus came to make sure that no one would put a stop to him being a part of God's plan. when he came to earth, he knew exactly the prophecies that were about him and he made sure no one would keep him from accomplishing what God sent him to do. And it's the same for us. Let's go to Luke chapter nine. My title for us is the call of disciplehip. The call of disciplehip. Because if Jesus came down to accomplish what God told him to do, what are we to accomplish? What what work must we finish? And in Luke chapter 9, I believe a passage we're all very familiar with. Let's start in verse 18. It says, \"While he was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, who do the crowds say that I am?\" They answered, \"John the Baptist, others Elijah, to others that one of the ancient prophets has come back. But you,\" he asked them, \"Who do you say that I am?\" Peter answered, \"God's Messiah.\" But he strictly warned and instructed them to tell this to no one, saying, \"It is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and be raised on the third day.\" So Jesus literally gathers his disciples. I kind of imagine, you know, at this time there's crowds of thousands. It says in the chapter before that all of Judea and Jerusalem knew about him. So l you have these crowds of people that heard of Jesus. They've seen his miracles. But it says here that he's talking amongst his disciples. I imagine, you know, they're kind of in a little getaway spot. You know, maybe there's a fire going on because you don't have like lights like this, right? Maybe some fire, some candles. It's it's more intimate. It's private, it says. And he asked them, \"Who do the crowd say that I am?\" And it's very revealing because amongst his his disciples, it says, \"Who does everyone else say that I am?\" And it's so revealing to today's day and age about those who love Jesus, want to follow him around, hear his teachings. They're all a part of the crowds, but they have no idea who he is. Literally, they say that some people in the crowd say he is John the Baptist. How does that make any sense? John the Baptist already exists. It's like saying that there's two of them. It doesn't make any sense. They're so confused on who Jesus is, all of the masses. But then you have those who actually follow him and they say, you know what, no, you are God's Messiah, the one that was has been prophesied for hundreds of years. And after hearing some answers, you know, he he lets them uh give their answer that, you know, yeah, you're right. I'm the Messiah. And then he responds saying, don't tell anybody. And the reason why he does this is because he doesn't want to die too fast. He doesn't want it being spread too fast. He has a certain mission to teach what he needs to teach before he dies too soon. And he literally goes into saying, \"I'm going to be rejected. I'm going to be hated. I'm going to be I'm going to suffer. I'm going to be killed.\" And then this is what he says right after in verse 23 says, \"Then he said to them all, if anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it. Whoever loses life because of me will save it. For what does it benefit someone if he gains the whole world and yet lose or forfeits himself? For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and that of the father and the holy angels. So think of everything we've talked up to up until this point. All the prophecies, all that he's going to suffer and undergo, the anguish, the torment, and now he's literally repeating it back to them. Now that he's actually here, I'm going to suffer. I'm going to be killed. And then he says right after that, do you want to follow too? And I think it's quite fascinating because he's literally saying, hey, I'm going to go through all of this. Who's with me? Who's who's going to come along and join me? And this is one of the more challenging passages that I believe is in the Bible. He's literally talking about all that he's going to undergo. And then says, do you want to join? You know the scriptures. You know what people say about me. You've already seen some of it. do you want to come along too? The call of disciplehip is the exact same today. And I I think that um you know one thing why I really love the scripture is not only that it's really challenging but he talks about self-denial in a way that is really unfamiliar. Like what is self-denial? And he follows it up with picking up your cross. And this is how he expands on what it means to deny yourself. picking up your cross. Of course, we know that it means, you know, how they died and back then being crucified for heinous crimes. So, he's literally saying, you must deny yourself and you must be willing to put your life on the line. Put it all on the table. Everything is for me. And that by losing it, it means that you no longer have ownership. When you deny yourself, you carry your cross. You're saying that you no longer have ownership over your life. And the opposite though is if you decide to preserve your way of living to keep how you want to live and your way of life in turn you actually lose your life. Your soul it was never yours to begin with. It's kind of like when you're you know shop shoplifting and you get caught in the middle of shoplifting and sometimes the guards they just come up they say just give me that we that's not yours. And that's what happens. We're living on borrowed time right now. this body is borrowed or this time is borrowed and we're literally and if we try to not give ownership back to God, we are shoplifting from him. We're literally stealing from him. But this passage I think is so powerful. I like to think of the Matrix with the red pill, blue pill moment, and I love that. I probably watch that scene, that two-minute clip like once a month. And it's, you know, you get so fascinated by the way they script movies sometimes. And it's like perfectly scripted. It's really cool. I'll probably say in the chat later, but you know, you have two choices, right? You have one choice, which your life is no longer your own. You know, you you it's not that you're a puppet, but your life was never yours to begin with. So, you give it right back to God. But what happens is that your eyes are opened to the truth. You see the world for what it truly is. So, therefore, you deny yourself and you live out that same truth. And that same truth is the reason why Jesus came down as God's word. And now, not only does he give you the life that is the light for all of mankind, but now you become the light that is the life for all of mankind as well. And then you have the other choice which is life can be whatever you want to be. You can live however you want to live according to your own desires. People, you know, they might seek endless money, endless possessions, endless pleasures. You know, you can be a good person. Why? Because you have no thing to stand on. And good is however you want to define it. And people choose to live this life. And why? Because they want the world to be at their fingertips. They believe freedom is doing whatever they want in the moments. But it says at the very end that your soul that you actually lose your soul. You lose your life. And so instead of going to the creator, you go to the destroyer. You're the one who steals, kills, and destroys. And many choose the second option for a lot less than endless pleasures, for a lot less than endless possessions. They literally settle even though they can't have what their hearts are desiring because God knows what they truly desire if only they would lose their life. And Jesus set that example uh when Wedline even shared in uh Matthew 26 about denying himself to go to the cross that even he had to surrender so that we can as well. And so knowing what Jesus was called to do to deny himself to suffer at the hands of sinners, atoning for the sins of all who follow him, and then also knowing what we're called to do, which is to follow in his footsteps. All of us here, we have to remember the calling that he gave us. The calling of disciplehip. So I want to ask you guys, do you remember your calling? Do you remember why you're here? The reason why you first uh study the Bible? The reason why you first said yes to when someone shared their faith with you? The reason why you kept going even though the studies got more challenging and then you got you got baptized and then, you know, discipling got challenging, but you're still here. Do you remember your calling for disciplehip? I have one point for us. Let's go to Luke chapter 5. One point. It's called re-enter the cycle. Luke chapter 5. I was preaching this a few weeks ago to the men at our men's midweek. And then I was writing this lesson and I I I want to find like, you know, what's what's a scripture that emphasizes Jesus first calling us to disciplehip? and it stays the same the rest of our lives. And it brought me back to the scripture. I'm like, you know what? Maybe there's another way I can kind of like revamp it. But I was looking at it. I'm like, no, this is really good. So, you're going to hear exactly what I preached to the men a few weeks ago. But I think that we're going to expand on it ever so slightly. Let's start in verse one of Luke chapter 5. Re-enter the cycle. It says, \"As the crowd was pressing in on Jesus to hear God's word, he was standing by Lake Ganesser. He saw two boats at the edge of the lake. Uh the fishermen had left them and were washing the nets. He got into one of the boats which belonged to Simon and asked him to put out a little from land. Then he sat down and was teaching the crowds from the boat. When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \"Put out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch.\" Master Simon replied, \"We've worked hard all night long and caught nothing. But if you say so, I'll let down the nets.\" When they did this, they caught a great number of fish and the nets began to tear. So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled the boat uh filled both boats so full that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus's knees and said, \"Go away from me because I'm a sinful man, Lord.\" For he and all those who were all those with him were amazed at the catch of fish they had taken. And so were James and John Zebedee sons who were Simon's partners. Don't be afraid. Jesus told them, \"From now on you will be catching people.\" Then they brought the boats to land, left everything and followed him. Re-enter the cycle. You know this passage once again, you had crowds that were literally pressing in on Jesus. So much so that he had to get in a boat and preach to them from there. And so once again, there's people that they want to hear him. They're eager to hear from him. But you see that there actually a select amount of people that take the first step in starting the cycle. See how he spoke to Peter. He says, \"Cast your nets back into the lake.\" But think of who Jesus was. Jesus was a carpenter. He he worked on wood. So imagine you're there. You're a fisherman. They were there all night. So you pulled an allnighter trying to catch fish and you caught not even one. And then a carpenter comes along who works with wood and says, \"Do it again.\" And he might be a little confused. Who is this carpenter? He knows nothing about fish. But Peter denied himself by rejecting his experiences. He didn't allow his experiences and what he did in the past to leak into his denial and obedience to Jesus Christ. He put it all behind. He denied himself and what it shows that he obeyed Jesus. A great miracle happened in a great abundance of fish and then he came to Jesus broken and it led to him leaving everything behind. More obedience. I find that this is the cycle that Jesus calls us to. Self-denial, obedience, then once you obey, you see great miracles. You see the miracles, then you're broken because of God's power. And the brokenness leads to more obedience. This is a cycle I believe every disciple must be in. And uh I really love it. And we want to kind of dig in to a little bit of what happens when we stop at a certain point in the cycle. So I want you guys to ask yourself right now, have you stopped in the cycle? Is there a point in any of the the way of life that Jesus called you to that you've completely stopped living? Well, let's see what it says. Well, let's see. Let's kind of dig into what it means, right? So, let's say you never started the cycle and you don't even deny yourself. That's just as simple as ignoring Jesus. There's many who ignore Jesus today, but I think because we're all sitting in this room, I think none of us who are really ignoring Jesus. Amen. That we're at least willing to hear it. I I'll hear you out at the very least, right? But then there are those who even deny themselves but don't obey. And what does this look like? You know, denying yourself starts at rejecting your experience. It starts at a very internal battle. But then that the internal denial turns into physical and external obedience. So even though you internally say, \"You're right. I must stop living the way that I live,\" doesn't mean that you read the word and initially obey it. You might still be like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there. Wait a minute. Like you're right. I don't like sin, but like I don't want to actually like go out and share my faith. I don't want to actually give time to other people. Like I kind of like my life the way that it is, but like I'll take on some aspects of self-denial. People who deny themselves but don't obey are the people that deceive themselves of being a Christian. Why? Because they started an internal battle and they believe that that's good enough. It's hard enough where it's at, but they never go the next step of obedience. And I'm sure you meet people like this. They talk all about fear. They talk all about anxiety, all of these internal struggles, but then you ask them, \"Do you ever share their faith?\" They say, \"What is that?\" Wow. I've never been in a Bible study. How do you do that? But they believe that they're Christians because they started the internal battle, but not the external one. But let's see what happens when you maybe deny yourself and obey. Uh but you don't see the miracles. Particularly, you don't believe in the miracles or you start to secularize the miracles. You view them in a very worldly lens. And the way this happens is, you know, you you deny yourself, you want to obey, but then you see people getting baptized and you compare it to yourself and you're like, \"No, like that's superficial.\" Wow. That's that's that's not a real conversion. Like they're not actually a disciple. You keep talking about, you know, growing your church. How about talk about the internal battle first? And they don't actually turn the obedience to submitting to God's miracles into seeing God's power. And the way this I I find this plays out a lot is you have a lot of people they talk about, you know, angel numbers, the depth of the scriptures, but you know, they don't actually see God's miracles and his power for what it truly is. People changing their lives and they don't reach the next step of brokenness. That's why a lot of these people who talk about all the depths of scriptures are super prideful. It makes total sense because they they don't start and see the God's power, Jesus's power for what it truly is. And it's supposed to lead you to brokenness. But I find even if they do see the miracles, but they're not broken, it means they're not learning from the miracle, they're supposed to learn. And I find in turn what happens is they believe that they're the source of the miracle. Wow. They see the power. They learn from it. But because it doesn't lead to brokenness and submitting to God's power, they start to industrialize the kingdom. They start to make it all about growth, all about numbers. And now all the miracles, all the righteousness, and now it becomes a righteousness of their own instead of one from Jesus. One that comes from brokenness and submitting to God. But even if you do all of that, you deny yourself, you obey Jesus, you see the miracle for what it is, and then you actually are broken by it, the last one, the fifth one is more obedience. And I find sometimes people stop there. They become broken, but they don't actually become more obedient. And what that looks like is maybe they become a disciple, they're converted, their heart is changed, they go through trial after trial, but they're tired of being broken. Wow. They're they're tired of being worn down by hardship. They don't want to endure it anymore. So, what happens is they become complacent. They stop exactly where they're at. Yes, they were broken. Yes, their heart is genuine, but it doesn't lead to greater things. Jesus, even though all those miracles that he did, the prophecies that were about him, he literally tells his disciples that you will do greater things than I do. And what he's opening us up to the cycle of uh denial, then obedience, then miracles, then brokenness, and then more obedience. And you keep going. And as you keep going more and more and more, you become more like him. But the more you are like him, the more suffering you endure. And people want to stop right there. And I find it's not that you do the cycle once or twice, but you keep going and you learn more and more and more. But I want you guys to ask yourself, have you stopped somewhere on this cycle? Have you stopped giving your all? Have you stopped that brokenness? Have you stopped that self-denial? You've denied yourself time and time again and it's led to more miracles. You've seen great things, but have you stopped denying yourself? Have you stopped being broken? Because you saw the miracles, but I'm tired. Because if I'm broken again, then I got to be more obedient, and I don't want to do more anymore. Wow. I want to be right where I'm at. See, I want to plead with you all to reenter the cycle. How can you do that? Start with this. Grab someone near you, someone who you're close to, someone you want to get close to, and be open with them. Be vulnerable with them. Say, \"I want to come back on the cycle. I want to live out disciplehip the way he's always called us to since the very beginning.\" So grab someone, be open, find out where you are in the cycle, and then press forward. Come back to Jesus. Let's close out of Philippians chapter 3. Philippians chapter 3, it says in verse two, watch out for the dogs. rough. Watch out for the evil workers. Watch out for those who mutilate the flesh. For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship by the spirit of God, boast in Christ Jesus, and do not put confidence in the flesh. Although I have reasons for confidence, this is exactly what led earlier. She wasn't boasting, she was sharing. Amen. And it says, \"Although I have uh reasons for confidence in the flesh, if anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more. Circumcised the eighth day of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews, regarding the law, a Pharisee, regarding zeal, persecuting the church, regarding uh the righteousness of the law, blameless. And you know, Paul, he could boast in all these different things. But going back to self-denial is you reject your experiences. So Paul is giving us the window to once again the cycle how it starts rejecting what you think you know is right and then now starting obedience. Let's keep reading. It says in verse 7, but everything that was a gain to me I have considered to be a loss because of Christ. More than that, I also consider everything to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ, Jesus, my Lord. Because of him, I have suffered the loss of all things and consider them as dung, so that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own from the law, but one that is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. My goal is to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings. Being conformed to his death, assuming that I will somehow reach the resurrection from among the dead. You know, Paul, I believe, here is talking all about that cycle. And you start off with the self-denial and then it goes into what we talked about in Luke chapter nine that he starts to actually follow Jesus. And what he does to do that is he leaves everything behind. As it says that if you want to save your life, you must lose it. And this is what it means. Like everything is not just his accomplishments that he leaves behind. He leaves everything behind. Everything is garbage. Everything is as mine says dunk. Everything is rubbish. What whatever your translation says, it's all gone. all for the surpassing value which I love because in Isaiah 53 that people didn't value him but now it says when you start this cycle he is a surpassing value a value that just keeps on growing there's no limit to his value other people don't value him at all give him negative value but we as followers give him unlimited value and then he goes on and I I love what he really says here he talks talks about his goal, his ambition. What is it? What does it say his ambition was? What does it say? To know Christ. He ambition started with knowing Christ. I imagine probably what it was like during the first century. You know, you hear about this Jesus guy. He's healing people's legs. He rose people from the dead, turned water into wine, broke all this bread to feed thousands of people, preaching all this crazy stuff. People want to kill him from day one. And then you're like, who is this guy? I want to know him. And that ambition that the disciples had when they called them to deny themselves and start this cycle, it was because they had the ambition, who is this guy? At the very least, I want to be his friends. I want to get to know him. So the only way you start this cycle is with the ambition to know Christ. That's the way you start and that's the way you finish. to know Christ. And I love the way he breaks it down. Says to know Christ is to know the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings. And the power of his resurrection, we know that Christ died, came to a new life so that we can do the same thing that we repent. We're we're new birth, new life. We're totally different. So knowing his resurrection is knowing repentance, knowing change, not being how you were when you walked in here, being completely different. And I love it because even Paul says that we are renewed day by day. So repentance is constant. And that's why it said you carry your cross how often? Daily. It's the same thing. And then says the fellowship of the sufferings that Noah is suffering. And we know that suffering in the Bible refineses you. It is discipline from the Lord. And to know truly his suffering, he's talking about being refined. So when it talks about continuous repentance, then being refined by God, it is once again the cycle that we read when Jesus first called his disciples. But in order to start that cycle, I want you guys to ask yourself, what is your ambition right now? I find what happens is sometimes we don't remember our calling. We don't remember the calling of disciplehip. Not because we completely forgot it, but because we stopped the cycle. Because our ambition is no longer to know Christ, but we have another competing ambition. It's distracting us from wanting to make Christ our our number one ambition, a surpassing value ambition. And now there's other things that we desire, other distractions in life that are now competing. And it makes sense because we're in a a spiritual war. And now there's a battle going on. And so we stop the cycle. But you have to actually make it your only ambition to know Christ. Everything will flow from that. I love it because even the Bible talks about those who work the work as if you're working for the Lord. So even if you have other things going on in your life, it's not saying to neglect those things, but make it all about knowing Christ. That's what it means to make God make Jesus knowing Jesus your ambition. So I want you to ask yourself, what is your current ambition? Is there anything that is distracting you from giving him all of your ambition, all of your desire, all of your pursuits? And this passage is is is powerful because once again, he came and he fulfilled all of these different prophecies. And all we're doing is wanting to know him because of that. Let me know why you came down here. Let me know why you had to die and be resurrected. Let me know about your suffering. I want to partake in all that you're going through, Jesus. And therefore, we start this cycle and even though you might be hurt time and time again, you're being refined by that hurt and you're becoming more and like him, more like him time and time and time again. So, I want all of us here to get back on that cycle. Find out if there's anywhere that you've stopped. Have you stopped being broken? Have you stopped obeying? Ha. Have you stopped seeing the miracles for what they truly are? And see exactly what he wants you to see so you can begin to obey him more and more. and you will be more like him as the day progresses. And I find that it's the same thing today. The same reason that they wanted to get on this cycle when Jesus first called them is because they wanted to know Christ. They saw what he was doing and they want to be a part of it. And it's the same calling today. Right now, we are disciples because we want to know Christ. We we want to see what he's doing and we want to participate in that. We we want to be his friends. We want to understand why he did what he did because we're tired of doing what we're doing. We want to deny oursel and actually call and actually obey his calling. So I think for today, let's remember, always remember the calling that he had for us. Find out where you stopped and then move forward and make it your ambition to know Christ. And I believe that if we do that, we will see this worldwide. Not because of just, you know, how much we obey or are the how much we see the miracles, but because it all starts with the ambition to know Christ. And all we're doing is spreading that ambition. We let other people see. Don't you want to see what he's done? Don't you want to be a part of all that he's done before, what he's continuing to do today. So, let us actually see this world one because of the ambition, not because of righteousness of our own, as it says in this passage, but because it all starts with what we truly desire.

It asserts that true discipleship involves self-denial, daily cross-bearing, and the willingness to lose one's life for Christ. The speaker introduces a cycle of discipleship—self-denial, obedience, miracles, brokenness, and more obedience—encouraging listeners to continually engage in this process. Ultimately, the sermon calls for an ambition to deeply know Christ, encompassing the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, as a pathway to becoming more like him.",

    "transcript": "Now, you know, I don't know if anyone here has seen the movie yet, but has anyone seen the new Lilo and Stitch? Anyone? Uh oh, some blues. That's aggressive. Uh I love Lilo and Stitch growing up. My mom, she spent a couple of years living in Hawaii and so she always loved that movie. Uh and I, you know, everyone knows, right? Ohana, right? Ohana means family and family means or forgotten, right? Uh and that was the main theme of that like that first movie where like there's this Hawaiian word. It means family, but it actually means a little bit more than family. In the second movie in the in the remake, the live action one, they sort of introduced this new Hawaiian word that that has a deeper meaning and it's kana. So it's kana and what that word means is like responsibility. But for in the Hawaiian culture, it really is is not just responsibility, but it's about the rights and the privileges that come with your responsibility. Uh and so for them, right, it's not just about obligation, but it's about the fact that like, hey, this is like my duty. This is my life. And really, it's been described as like their legacy, right? Their purpose in life is their kana. Uh and so today, Chris Jones and I, we want to talk about your spiritual kana. Uh and really talk about your spiritual legacy. So let's go to first Timothy chapter 4. So 1 Timothy chapter 4. And in verse 16, the Bible says, \"Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\" Right? And so the Bible is very very clear that we have to watch the way that we live. We have to watch our actions, but we also have to watch what we're teaching, right? What we are influencing other people to believe is true and is right and is wrong, right? It says that when you watch this closely, you also need to then persevere in that, right? Meaning it's going to be a struggle. It's going to be tough, but it's all for two purposes, right? Two responsibilities. The first one in the title of my sermon is to save yourself, right? The Bible says that you got to save yourself, right? This was Paul. Obviously, we know God saves us, but here the responsibility of making it all the way to heaven falls solely onto you, right? You know, save yourself, right? I like the the words of the famous poet uh Ice Cube where he says, right, you better check yourself before you wreck yourself. All right? And the Bible says you got to save yourself in not just this one place. Look at Acts chapter 2, right? In Acts chapter 2, we read in 1 Timothy, that was Paul. Uh, I'm pretty sure Paul's in heaven. Amen. Well, this time it's Peter. Okay. Another guy that I'm pretty confident made it all the way. And Peter in Acts 2:40, it says, \"With many other words, Peter warned them and he pleaded with them, save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" Right? The Bible says that you need to save yourself. Why do you need to save yourself? Well, if we back it up in Acts chapter 2, verse 22, Peter's preaching for the very first time, and he says, \"Men of Israel, listen to this. Jesus of Nazareth, uh Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.\" This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and fornowledge. And you with the help of wicked men put him to death by nailing him to the cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. Drop down to verse 36. Peter says, \"Therefore, let all Israel be assured of this. God has made this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ.\" Right? Why do you need to save yourself? Because here Peter clearly states that you are the problem. He says you are responsible for killing Jesus Christ. Now if we put ourselves here in this moment, this was during the the day of Pentecost, which was a Jewish holiday. So if you're a good-hearted Jew, sort of like in today, if you were just a good-hearted religious person, you show up to your church on Sundays, you show up, you know, on Wednesdays, the Fridays, the this and that, you just show up. You you know, you understand that you should be here. you understand that God is real and you need to believe in him. That's who these people were. They're showing up here to Jerusalem. And some of them, if you back up in Acts chapter 2, they came all the way from Asia. They came from Africa. They came from all parts of the world. And now here Peter is saying, \"You killed Jesus just the other day.\" Right? Now, how like if I if I was there, you know what I mean? Doing my absolute best for God. If I came all the way from Egypt to Jerusalem and then now a fisherman is telling me that I killed Jesus and I need to change what I'm doing, I would be pretty confused and I'd probably, you know, dismiss him. Be like, I don't know. I don't really, you know, trust you or anything like that, right? But here, Peter's saying that no, you are the problem. Right? My first point, and I want I want you guys to write this one down. All right? Write it big and bold. I am the problem. All right? you are the problem. You see, in today's society, no one wants to take responsibility, right? Dads don't want to be dads, moms don't want to be moms, so they they go through an abortion, right? And and the Republicans blame the Democrats. The Democrats blame the Republicans. No one wants to take responsibility. I even struggle with this, too. Amen. Right? I'm teaching my kids and if they get a really good score on the state standardized test, right? It's out of five. If they get a five out of five, I'm like, \"That's my boy.\" like that's my that's my that's my student right there. But if they get, you know, like a two or a one, I'm like, I don't I, you know, what's their what's their life like at home? I don't know. Maybe this this I don't want to take it personal. I don't want to accept that responsibility, right? But but that's not right. Amen. Uh, you know, the best example we have of this is really what the Bible tells us about the Garden of Eden, right? Adam and Eve are there. They don't even know what evil is. They're literally walking around with God. It says that on the It literally says in Genesis that on the cold or the cool breeze of the day, the Lord was walking in the garden. Like whoa, what a what a fire, you know, like picture in your head. What a visualization to be chilling with God. And here you are, you don't even know evil. You just eat from this tree that gives you life forever and ever. Like what a like not bad, right? But then all of a sudden, perfect circumstances, perfect situation. But what do Adam and Eve do? They sin. All right. Now, fast forward a couple thousand years and you have Jesus Christ who gets baptized and it says that the spirit descended on him and it says that God says, \"This is my son whom I love. With him I'm well pleased and immediately the spirit takes him into the wilderness into the desert where for 40 days he doesn't eat and he is tempted by Satan.\" And does he sin? Absolutely not. Right? So what does this teach us? But you can never blame anything or blame anyone for the decisions that you make that cause you to sit. Right? We are the problem. Turn with me to Ezekiel chapter 18. To save yourself, you got to understand that you are the problem. So Ezekiel chapter 18 and in verse 20 this is the Lord speaking and he says the soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him. Right? You are responsible for yourself. You cannot blame anyone or any situation for who you are, right? But you got to take full ownership of that, right? For me in my life growing up, right, I I I grew up with a sort of an emotional need uh that I that I had to sort of meet with different vices when I was younger, right? At first, it started pretty harmless. It was just an obsession with sports, but then pretty soon it became an obsession with really sinful things, right? a lot of addiction to impurity and then turning to drug and alcohol use and then ultimately you know what I would do often was just manipulate and take advantage of people for my own benefit right and all of these decisions that I was going through the only result that ever came from it was a lot of shame right and when you sort of hit that spot of like well I never thought that this is who I actually was and this is who now like I really am after you make a decision that you know you just sort of can't identify with you have to make a decision to sort of all right am I just going to decide to to take my life or am I going to sort of somehow decide to masquerade it another way right and that's why I'm so grateful for the the communion and even for Mitch's contribution because it was all about how we need to be honest with ourselves right we got to know ourself uh and you know for me it was it was that's what it took I had to realize that I was the problem that I couldn't blame anyone or anything even though you know to some people I could have right I could have blamed the world. I could have blamed society. I could have blamed the people that were around me and in my life. But I had to understand when I studied the Bible that I am the problem. I made all of those decisions that got me to to really be ashamed of myself. Right? And and this is what it takes. And the moment that you accept that you are the problem is the moment that all of a sudden you realize that you are flat loved by God. because you're like, \"Oh my gosh, how in the world did he let me get away with all of the sinful things that I was doing? Man, he loves me.\" Right? The moment that you accept that you are the problem, you become absolutely free. You realize like, man, I don't I don't got to be embarrassed about anything. Like what Chris said, right? Like I'm free. I don't I don't got to worry about nothing, right? I'm not here to impress anyone or anything. Like I'm literally here solely for God's attention, right? And and when you accept uh that that you are the problem, that's when all of a sudden you get to become new, right? That's when you realize, oh man, I get to throw off all of these old ways and I get to decide about every single thing that I'm going to do in my life going forward. And I'm going to make every single decision to please God instead of to turn away from him. Amen. Right. A challenge I have for us as a church, you guys, is to take complete responsibility of your life. Right? You got to own your life. You have to own who you are. The Bible says it's by the grace of God that you are what you are. Right? You got to own your past. You got to own your present and you got to own your future. Right? Every decision you got to own it. The good ones, but especially the bad ones. Amen. And you of course have to own your sin. You see, when you accept yourself as the problem, that allows you to now be able to become the solution, right? Otherwise, if you're going to outsource the problems in your life, well, then you just outsource the solution and you're going to forever be miserable and you're going to forever keep digging a deeper hole and you're going to always wonder why why why why is this happening to me in my life? But if you can accept that you are the problem, then you can also be the solution. Right? Take note, take note of Jesus. Jesus, did he ever sin? No. But when he died on the cross, what did he become? He became sin. He saw the world and he said, \"Man, they have a really big problem. They all keep sinning and no one can help each other.\" So, how about I just become the problem. That way, I can become the solution, which is salvation for us. Right? My second point, I want you to write this one a little bit bigger and underline it. And that is, I am the solution. All right? As we continue in Ezekiel 18 verse 21, it says, \"But if a wicked man turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, he will surely live. He will not die. None of the offenses he has committed will be remembered against him because of the righteous things he has done. He will live.\" \"Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the sovereign Lord? Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? Right? Drop down to verse 30. It says, \"Therefore, oh house of Israel, I will judge you, each one according to his ways, declares the sovereign Lord. Repent, turn away from all your offenses. Then sin will not be your downfall. Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, oh house of Israel? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the sovereign Lord. Repent and live. Point number two, I am the solution. Right? You all are the solution. What does it take? It's very simple. It's repentance. Right? Often times we want to understand more. We want to understand a deeper thing. We want to be able to explain and justify why we're doing everything that we're doing, right? And and and you can learn a lot about yourself by doing that. But the simple response is to just repent. Wow. To take ownership of your life and to repent. Look at Acts chapter 2 again. And we see that God's message has never changed. In Acts chapter 2 and verse 36, we'll read this again. It says, \"Therefore, let all Israel be assured of this. God has made this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ. When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off for all whom the Lord our God will call. Right? You are the solution. What does it say you have to do? What does Peter say? You got to repent and be baptized. That word repent in Greek is metaninoia. All right? And meta kind of like metamorphosis. If you remember elementary school, you learn about the butterfly and the c the right the caterpillar goes into the little cocoon and it becomes a butterfly. Right? That's metamorphosis. Meta means change. So metaninoia it means change. Noia means mind. So you got to have a change of mind. Right? And so this is this is what helps us. Romans 12 1-2 write this down, right? It says that in view of God's mercy, you need to no longer conform to the patterns of this world, but to instead transform yourself to conform to the patterns of the word of God. Right? This is what repentance truly is. Right. And so for for you know people out there that are struggling, my challenge is man, whatever sin that it is that you're struggling with, it's it's for a lack of a change of mind, right? You haven't quite figured it out. And so whatever it is, I encourage you to talk to as many brothers or sisters that you got to talk to to have that change of mind to see that new perspective. That way you can finally be free from that sin. Right? Uh the the best way that I love this, it's in Colossians 2. Uh that segus right into Colossians 3 uh where it literally says that to to simply try and tell yourself to not do this or to not do that is a worldly way of thinking. But in Colossians 3 verse 1-2, it says that you need to set your mind and your heart on things above. Right? A change of mind is going to make you just stop doing all those things. If you're just going to say, \"Oh, I can't do this, so I got to stop doing it.\" That's worldly. Your mind hasn't changed, right? So repentance, it's really simple. Uh but but we can kind of make the simple things difficult. Uh right, the Bible says that you got to save yourself, right? And how is this really possible? We're not saved by anything that we could do. Amen. We're not saved by works. We're not saved by, you know, our our own capabilities. But the best way that I think about this is imagine you're lost. You're in sin. You're in the middle of the ocean, right? Like you're you're you're treading water. You're out there. There's no one near you, but all of a sudden you see a boat start coming over, right? And you see this boat, so you're flailing. You're flailing your hands and all of a sudden the boat, you know, tooth it is to horn and it starts coming over to you, right? And as it gets closer to you, the captain gets out, he throws you a life raft. That way you can hop in and that way he can pull you in and now you're saved. Amen. So what did it take to save you? Well, was it the boat? Was it the captain? Was it the life raft? Or was it you that had to grab the life rafts? Well, it was all of the above. D, right? The the answer was D. All of the above. And that's what it is, right? But none of it is possible without the captain, which is Jesus Christ. All right? And so Jesus will save us, but man, you better grab the life wrap and repent and be baptized. And so, if you're a disciple here today, find that thing, know that thing. You probably already know it. Amen. About what you really got to repent of and go after a change of mind. Right? you can't really crack it out yourself, right? Then then that's why you got to go talk to your brothers and sisters. This is a gift from God to have one another. And if you feel like you haven't repented, right, or if you haven't been baptized, man, study the Bible with whoever invited you out today. Amen. Right? Because this is God's way of of helping us to be saved and for us to truly be able to save ourselves. You see, family, God gave us an incredible mission, right? His mission was to make disciples of all nations, right? that that's literally the task of saving the entire world. Amen. And and God doesn't need us to do anything. But he wants us to help. He wants us to experience what we can do if we trust in him. Right? And so really, family, we got to save the world. But it's hard to save the world when you can't save yourself. Amen. And so, family, with that, you got to save yourself by knowing that one, you are the problem, but two, you are the solution. And with that, I give you Chris Jones. Great job, bro. No. Wonderfully done, Mike. Um, what I want to kind of carry the torch. You talk about how you are to save yourself. Um, my title is the Savior Hearers. Um, turn with me and park in uh 1 Thessalonians chapter 2. My only point is that you got to tell yourself I am the messenger. I am the bridge. What does that mean? Like you have to really own your life. Like Mike was talking about truly own it. The good, the bad, the ugly. Once you own yourself, now the second part of the mission is you got to save your hearers, the people that are around you, the people that you influence, that is what that's what you have to do. You have to take ownership of that. Um your walk with God and your influence with other for with others, that bridge is ownership. You have to be the bridge in order for people to know who Jesus is. and to give them a chance to repent of their sin and to save themselves. What is ownership? It's actively taking responsibility for everyone and anything around you. Um, ownership doesn't just say, \"Hey, I know God.\" What ownership says if God placed them in my life, then I have an opportunity to play a part of their salvation, of their growth, and of their healing. I have a part in that. And because what ownership says is I know God, therefore, I'm going to show up for the people that God has given me. You have to own your influences. You got to own your witness. And you got to own the effort of your love and the weight of your life. To save your hearers doesn't mean just giving them the truth. That's simple. The next step is giving them your entire life. That's not so simple. And people don't want to do it. And I mean, look at Jesus. Jesus gave himself. I I I'm not sure that I would be crucified for anybody that I don't know. To be crucified, to be hung on the cross and to suffer for that long. Jesus did that. And really with ownership, don't be a victim. Don't be a victim. Take it from me who used to be a professional victim. Don't be a victim. Let's go to uh let's go to first Thessalonians in chapter 2. And I really want to focus in and hone in really how Paul explained his ministry and how his heart towards the people in Thessalonica really was. And because Paul followed Jesus, this is a result. In verse one, it says, \"You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit with you, visit to you was not without results. We had previously suffered and been treatedly outrageously in Philippi. As you know, with the help of our God, we dare to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition. For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor do we try uh trying to trick you. On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We're not trying to please people, but God who tests our hearts. You know, we never use flattery, nor do we put on a mask to cover up grief. God is our witness. We're not looking for praise from people. No, not from you or anyone else. Even though we are apostles of Christ, we could have considered our authority. Instead, we were like young children among you. Just as a nursing mother cares for her children, we so we cared for you. Because we loved you so much, we are delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God, but our lives as well. Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship. We work night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preach the gospel of God to you. You are a witnesses and so is God of how holy, righteous, and blameless we were among you who believe. For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with their own children, encouraging, comforting, urging you to live lives worthy of God who calls you into his kingdom and glory. And we also thank God continually because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as human word but what it actually is, the word of God which indeed is at work in you who believe. For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus. You suffered from your own people, the same things those churches suffered from the Jews, who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and also drove us out. They displeased God, and they are hostile to everyone, an effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so they may be saved. In this way, they always heap up the sins to the limit. And the wrath of God has come upon them at last. Um, but brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time in person, not in thought, out of our intense longing, we made every effort to see you. For we wanted to come to you, certainly I, Paul, again did again and again, but Satan walked away. For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown of which we glory in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ when he comes? Is it not you? Indeed, you are our glory and joy. This is Paul owning saving his heroes. Look at how he really broke broke it down in verse 1 to2. He overcame great persecution. His life was on a literal line, but that did not stop him from going to the people that he loved and preaching the gospel. Um, in verses 3-6, I love how Paul said he had a pure motive. A pure motive. There's no agenda there. And in verses 5-6, he doesn't use people. He does not seek power nor validation for anyone. They simply preach the word. ownership of your hearers and of your disciples. It feels like family. Anybody that's in a healthy functioning family, every person from child to mother and father has a part to play. And when we are there for each other and in each other's lives, it builds a strong family. In verse 10, Paul urged people to live lives worthy of the gospel. That means there's got to be one or two uncomfortable conversations that are mixed up in there. And he speaks with authority, but yet with compassion. When Paul was talking, you knew who was in charge. He didn't have to assert his authority because he knew who he was, what he came to do, and he knew and he took ownership of the people and the souls in Thessalonica. You know, for me, I look at my life and I look at some of the singles in here, the people who are in their 20s, man, they got their lives together, man. Like, no. Much better than me. Cuz in my 20s, I was I made excuses for everything. Hey, Chris, why didn't you finish school? Well, the 2008, you know, recession happened and couldn't afford to go to school. I mean, it's a good sounding excuse because those who live through that time, oh boy, what a time. Um, I used to say, you know, why can't you do this or that? Oh, I just don't have time or I don't know. I it's not part of my priority to this. I I don't feel like doing it. Or that's too hard. I don't want to. Uh, I was a perpetual victim. I I did not take responsibility for nothing. And I look dumb doing it. I look absolutely like. So, brothers, when I challenge your excuses, I'm trying to help you to grow out of that that mentality because like you got to own your life because if you're a guy that doesn't have a job, that doesn't add value to anyone's life, that makes excuses there, there's nothing you can bring to anyone that's good. And if you're mad at me, good. You have to bring ownership in value. You have to be able to do what is hard. And that goes for both men and women. I'm just speaking as a guy. That's just my experience. But you got to understand that you have to not be trapped by excuses. Stop with the excuses. Oh man, I I got up late because, you know, I'm at church late because I got up late. Well, get up and die. You know, it's like when you don't take responsibility, you reject your opportunity for growth at every time. I could have been sharper much sooner in life, but I rejected it because I believed my excuses and I believed I was a victim. I avoided a responsibility. I didn't want to lead a Bible talk. No way. Me lead some lead other people. Are you sure? Did you pray and consult with God before making this decision? Do you understand who you asking? You got to understand I avoided responsibility because I feared failure. Anybody who is has any semblance of success is very understanding of what failure is. And you have to be willing to fail and fail often and fail over and over and learn. You know, I avoid responsibility in order not to look bad. If I'm not in charge of anything, I can't look back. If I don't if I'm not in charge of planning, I can blame whoever planned it. If it tanked, it's their fault. And honestly before I met my wife and if you want to know an existence of there is a god I am married. God is real. He exists. In my other relationship before I was with Ben there were dumpster fires and I blamed the other person for a very long time until I said no I was the problem. I was codependent emotionally and I love people for my self-esteem, not my principal. You got to understand um making excuses and and outsourcing what needs the needs of the church. You got to step up and meet the needs. Like if you say something, don't talk to me about it. I'm the last person you want to because I'm going to probably tell you to do it. If you see weaknesses, shortcomings, uh any gaps, you know, the the when God revealed that to you, he he revealed you to act. You were here for this reason. Esther, why was she pre uh why was she the queen? For the very reason to save her people at a time like this. You gota you got to understand that in order to bring salvation to others, you yourself have to be responsible and you have to have a consistent uh you have to have a consistent example of responsibility. Be don't be afraid to fail. You know, Nelson Mandela said um I don't I don't lose, I learn. And here we got to understand that if you're afraid of taking more responsibility or you you are afraid to step up, you're afraid to elevate, you need to be around people that are going to challenge you by the word of God and help you elevate anyway in your discomfort. It is uncomfortable growing. I mean physically, you know, puberty was a thing. Like when you grow, it hurts. Your body's consistently sore, but you have no choice but to grow. Spiritually, you got to have that mentality. You have no choice but to grow. You know what does what does what's the opposite of ownership? It's neglect, abandonment. And here I want to show what neglect produces. Um, neglect produces a broken foundation. When you neglect to be responsible, it leads to it collapses in families. Uh, it collapses our unity and it can collapse temp communities and countries. What does neglect also produce? Spiritual gaps. When there's neglect or there's a struggling or a weak brother and sister and everybody says not my job, the enemy slips in and he takes over. There's delay growth when there's neglect. If people under your leadership aren't growing, it's time to assess yourself because people remain immature if you don't lead uh decisively or effectively or you fail to disciple the things that are hard to disciple. You know what does neglect also produce? Recycled trauma. You're going to project your life experiences to everybody and to God himself. And you can't see anything good. You can't see God. You can't see a good people. Well, this neglect also manifests miss opportunities because you said it's not your job, not your Bible talk, not your wheelhouse. You miss opportunity to impact change in people's lives. There is relational collapse. Trust is broken when you remain present but show yourself to be inconsistent, irresponsible, and absent. What neglect produces is spiritual silence. You go with the flow of the world. You don't speak up. You're not principal and what you're doing. You don't stand up on conviction and false teachers will fill the void in others lives. And honestly, and this is what uh this is what really scares me, is a wasted legacy. If you continually be the victim and not help other people's out and not use your talent for God, your impact is done. It's killed. You officially kill your own impact. You leave your calling for God unfulfilled and your name quickly forgotten, you know. And for me, I don't care if my name's remembered. I have a very common name. Like there's a thousand Christopher Jones. I just want to be remembered by God. Amen. What's what are the effects of ownership when everybody in the church obeys God, is repentant, gives their entire lives and not simply be religious. This is what happens. You have a strong foundation that repairs things that were damaged by sin and you build people up on said foundation. There is spiritual fortitude meaning there are no gaps that everybody has the same conviction. No matter their age, no matter their place in life, Jesus Christ is Lord and nothing else matters. Everyone steps up. Everybody can preach. Everybody can lead a Bible talk. Everybody can lead because Jesus Christ himself is a leader. There is widespread growth. And I'm not talking about spiritual growth. That is that's automatic. When you're in a good, healthy um church that takes ownership for each other, people grow. And not just spiritually. People grow in their lives as well. Men who were formerly immature or mature enough to have to be married and have family. Thank God for the men in my life. And you got to also know that, you know, there could be sharpness, too. There are some sharp uh people that are in their career, people that'll sit down and redo your resume and if you don't have a resume, create a resume, tell you how to interview, tell get take you to the goodwill to dress up. Well, that's ownership. You can tell somebody to get a job, but it's better to show them this is what you need to do. Give you the tool. Now, you can defy that. You can have healed trauma people. I love Maria's communion. I think I resonated with that because when you heal over trauma, you are victorious and you can help others overcome their trauma, too. You have seized moments. You make the most of God's opportunity to you and you can make an internal impact on the life of a family, a life of mult multiple of people that you will never see in your life. But because he took the opportunity, God is glorified. Relational trust is built again. When you're in a healthy situation, people trust each other. Not because they're perfect. I mean, come on. I'm up here preaching. No one's perfect. But their love is based on the principle of Jesus Christ. That can't be replaced. You can't fake that. You can be religious, but you can't fake li sacrificing yourself and building and putting people first and building that trust. You have a messenger's voice. You will stand up for what is right when everyone wants to do wrong. You know, I I shared this with a brother recently and I forgot it. When I was a baby Christian, I had somebody who was a disciple. They what they did was they had an internship at ABC and it was a great internship and uh he came to me one day and he asked me if I can uh take his sample because he consumed marijuana and he was going to fail the drug test. And in that moment, I said no. Because I knew in my I I could have done the homie a favor or I could have been principled and told him no. You need to own your you need to own the decision. I can't help you, bro. And unfortunately, that brother fell away long ago. And really when you have a strong and own your life and own the life of others, you're not afraid to speak up even if there's abuse on and honestly you'll have an enduring legacy. You know, if what I what I love about different people um are even I'll just talk about the Tampa church, the legacy that we leave whenever we're on conferences. high praise because people in Tampa, we're awesome here. I love each and every one of you. And you put your best foot forward not to impress other people, but because of who you were, because you surrendered yourself to Christ, because you are responsible, because you take ownership of your life, people see the light in your life. And honestly, each and every one of us has people that we know, that we influence, people who do not know Jesus. And my question to each and every one of you is you know have you impact your circle of people and if you haven't what are you waiting for? If you go if you um build in faith your actions will echo into eternity because your decisions will obey. And if you own obedience and you call other people to obey, that's an impact in eternity as well. Um, to end off the my part of the lesson, this is what I want to really impress upon you all. Be the messenger and be the bridge that people need to get to Jesus. Take full ownership of your own life and then take ownership of the church. It's not anyone else's church. It's I'm part I'm church and this is church and I am a part of it. And I want you guys to violently lead others to Christ. To God be the glory.",

    "summary": "The sermon \"Save Yourself & Your Hearers\" explores the spiritual concept of \"kana\" or legacy, urging listeners to take responsibility for their spiritual lives and for influencing others. Speaker Michael Schmidt emphasizes that individuals must first acknowledge \"I am the problem\" by taking ownership of their sins, then realize \"I am the solution\" through repentance and baptism. Chris Jones then expands on the responsibility to \"save your hearers\" by being \"the messenger\" and \"the bridge,\" sharing not only the gospel but also one's life with others, as exemplified by Paul in 1 Thessalonians 2. The sermon concludes by stressing that saving the world begins with saving oneself and taking full ownership of one's life and the church's mission.",

    "series_number": 36,
    "transcript": "plan was to go over in Genesis chapter 3 the nature of sin and looking at uh the first few verses of why the the first sin was the way it was and what it means for us. So let's go to Genesis chapter 3. And if you don't typically take notes, maybe today is the day. the t-shirt. The t-shirt in Genesis chapter 3. Uh well, my title for you guys is do not be conformed to the nature of sin. Do not be conformed to the nature of sin. In Genesis chapter 3 and verse one, just the first verse, it says, \"Now the serpent was more cunning of all the wild animals that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, \"Did God really say you can't eat from any tree in the garden?\" Okay, this is the first verse we're going to really break down. And I'm going to say a lot of words to try to break it down uh as much as I can. And because of that, if what I say seems kind of off or confusing, be free to hit me with a It actually helps me. But funny enough, like it's not just like the Oh, come on, bro. But even the Okay, what is that, bro? Like that that actually helped it too, funny enough. Um, and so we're going to break down this verse. So, let's look at how, you know, Satan, the serpent, this is his the very first time he speaks in the Bible. So, let's understand how significant this really is. The very first thing he says is, \"Did God really say?\" That is the very first thing out of Satan's mouth. And let's understand this. This is actually a closedended question. There are lots of questions that we get asked that we could be asked and they have different purposes. A closedended question is meant to narrow your response. But it also has a second purpose which is to test your commitments. And so it's it's a yes or no question to really see which side do you really stand on? So when Satan says did God really say he is testing Eve to see what are you really standing on? What is your true conviction? And it's quite powerful because it reveals a hidden nature within whoever is responding even within us ourselves. And here what it reveals oftent times is are you half-hearted? Are you doubleminded? or are you simply unsure of what the scriptures really say? And what it'll lead to what when these question is asked and it's not dealt with properly, it leads to you committing an action out of half-heartedness, committing an action out of being double-minded or an action of unsurity or doubts. And I find this is what is commonly true is that sin is typically birthed from a question. Sin is typically birthed from a question. And I find that there are many questions that we can ask ourselves. You know, it could simply be, is this really sin? I think that's a common one many people might have, but I find even other ones. It's like, is it really sin if it doesn't harm anybody? Is it really sin if I feel good afterwards? And there's so many questions that people ask themselves, but we'll look further on the passage of why that really happens. But I like the question itself uh when you look at it because did God really say you can't eat from any tree in the garden? So this is Satan purposefully misquing God. God did not say this, but it's actually quite powerful because the statement, the question is wrong enough to elicit Eve to talk back to Satan. It is it is so blatantly wrong. She's like, \"Wait a minute. Let me talk to you real quick. But talking to your temptation is never fruitful. It is never helpful. And so Satan said just the right thing to get Eve to notice him, to get Eve to pay attention to him. And it's quite powerful. And I I think it's also a powerful question because I think Satan is cunning enough to also target where we are weakest. Um so we know that Satan did not go God did not say you can't eat from any tree. Let's see what God really said in Genesis 2 in verse 16. It says, \"And the Lord God commanded the man, you are free to eat from any tree of the garden, but you must not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for on that day you eat from it, you will certainly die.\" So God did not say you cannot eat from any tree. He said the opposite. The first thing God said is, \"You are free.\" That is the first thing that he told them. But you know what happens with our sinful nature is that what the even though someone might say you're free to do something when we hear even one rule of don't eat from that tree. The only tree there are two there are two pretty good trees. There's the tree of of you know of life and God didn't say you can't eat from that one. Says you can't eat from this one specific tree. And I find what happens is in our sinful nature is we ask ourselves is it really freedom if there are rules? How free am I really? If if I'm limited, God, are you limiting me right now? I I I think I know what's best for me. I should have knowledge. I know what I need. And so, and what Satan is doing and he he is picking a specific question, the target where Eve is weakest. And I find one specific thing is do we really trust in God's commands? But I think the the statement itself is kind of powerful or the question itself because God actually gave this command to Adam. So Adam would have had to relay it to Eve. So it's actually not just testing Eve's trust in God, but Eve's trust in God's messenger. And and I find this is where a lot of sin is birthed is it is sin against God or sin against people. And so the question is very specific in nature to find where what is Eve weaken how much does she really trust in God's people how much does she really trust in God's commands and uh you know it starts from a simple question a simple question to see where are you weakest and family I want to ask you guys right now what questions are you allowing Satan to ask you What what questions are you allowing Satan to ask you? Are are you questioning his commands? Questioning his his word? If it really brings true freedom, if it really is the purpose you're looking for, does it really give you peace? Even though like you know it comes with trials and it comes with discipline, is that really peace and you're questioning what God has to say? Or on the other end, are you questioning his people? You know, it's not wrong to ask, you know, your brother or sister a question. Even after this lesson, if you want to come approach me, ask me a question. I'm, you know, I'm all ears. But do you question the validity of God's people? Do you question their love? Do you question their sincerity? And I find sometimes even though we all make mistakes, you know, maybe it's our tone or attitude or we blatantly, you know, sin against each other. We're a family. It happens. We're not perfect. But when you live a life where you're constantly skeptical of God's people around you, that is not a place that is worth staying. And I find this is what Satan, the tempter, is going at Eve with. And the second thing I want to ask you guys is, do you talk back? Is Satan asking you questions? And do you talk back? You know what happens is the questions we allow to marinate. We allowed it to, you know, seep into the the finest, deepest parts of our soul. But, you know, God's commands, God wanting us to love his word, to love prayer, is God wanting us to stop giving attention and focus to what Satan is trying to tell us and give attention to him, to read his word, to constantly be in the fellowship, to hear advice, godly advice, so we no longer listen to what Satan is trying to tell us. And so I think you know what we have to really learn is not to allow Satan, not to allow temptation to speak to us and then speak back to us. It's very important because talking back is meant to make us slip up. The moment we speak back, the moment we give it focus, that is when Satan finally got a foothold. Satan is finally, okay, great. I got his or her attention. This is just what I wanted. Here we go. Now we can get into it. So let's keep reading. Let's see what else happens in this verse. In uh verse two of chapter 3 says, \"The woman said to the serpent, we may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden.\" Okay, so she got that right. But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, \"You must not eat it or touch it or you will die.\" So in this verse right here, I believe Eve made three mistakes. One of them we just looked at. She talked back to Satan. She allowed it to be a conversation. And you know, it's not like today that Satan is literally a snake riding around, you know, just you open your backpack and you jump out and it's a snake there. But but Satan speaks to our weakest points in our hearts. So I find what it is is we think that, you know, we're we're just really thinking, we're deep in thought, but really what it is is we're having a conversation with Satan. And so it's very important to ask yourself, you know, are you talking back? Right? And you know, there's a powerful scripture in Isaiah 9:18. It talks about how sin is like a fire and how it spreads and it burns everything down. And fire is very interesting because at certain dishes, you're like, \"Oh, this is nice. This is warm. This is comfortable. You know, my body is warm enough. It's better to be warm than to be cold, I guess, for some people. I guess you have to get used to it if you live in certain places. But, you know, it's like a s like a fire and it just burns everything. And even from a distance, it might even feel nice. But fire is quite interesting because not only does it, you know, suck out all the oxygen to create the flame, but fire creates one of the most deadliest and permanently damaging toxin to the Earth's ecosystem, which is carbon monoxide. And you know, even though if you were in a boxed off room and you had a fire going, it might suck out all the oxygen, but before you know, you die of suffocation from the oxygen, you would actually pass out from inhaling all the smoke, all the carbon monoxide. And what'll actually happen is that you will pass out and then you will die a painless death. So, it's quite interesting to think about fire. Though it might feel warm, when you start to play with it, you might die slowly and painlessly and not even realize it. And so I think it's important to realize, you know, that even this passage was quite literally playing with fire. She allowed it to get close. She wanted to have a conversation with it. But that is not how God wants us to operate. You know if you know where we are being tempted, God wants us to look at that and completely move on because temptation will give birth to sin and sin gives birth to death. Amen. And so what do we do is we want to I want to get open even from the temptation level. Why? Because I don't even want to have a conversation with Satan. And the second thing I believe she did wrong is she downplayed God's command. How did she do this? Well, let's see what she said. She said that God uh about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden. And so she simply called the tree the tree that is in the middle of the garden. But God calls it the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And so what happens very commonly is that God assigns a very specific significance to his word and then we downplay it. It is simply just another tree, a tree in the middle of a garden rather than the only tree God told you not to eat from. And so what happens is we start to downplay God's word. We do this constantly. And it could be in the instance of, you know, saying uh, you know, God doesn't just want us to come to church. He actually wants us to encourage one another daily. But sometimes, you know, we downplay God's word on what's the purpose of fellowship and we ask oursel these different questions. You know, God doesn't just want us to stop sinning. He wants us to deny oursel and carry our cross daily. But sometimes we apply a different significance to what that means. You know, God doesn't want us to just share our faith or be in Bible studies. He wants us to make disciples of all nations. And there is a specific significance that God has assigned to his word. You know, it's not just about logging in your daily quota of your, you know, reading your scripture, having a 15-minute prayer, but it literally says to pray without ceasing. Your life should be a prayer. Every moment you recognize God's significance. Every moment you're crying out to him. You're pleading to him. And so, we cannot downplay God's word just as he did. The third thing she did wrong, which was the more obvious one, is she added to God's word. She said or touch it. That was something that God did not say. But what it is is she assigned her own interpretation to what it was. So God did have a significance for what it was, but he didn't say not to touch it. Even though it was significant, she applied her own meaning to what God said, which completely added to God's word. And we'll look at right now which is quite interesting because it could have been an innocent mistake. It could have been something that maybe you know Adam didn't relay to her all the information. You know the Bible doesn't quite state why she said that. But the reality is whenever you know an innocent mistake is made that leads to developing a false conviction, you don't want to let that false conviction go unchecked. You don't want to let that false conviction go uncorrected. And you could always recover from a false conviction is anyone can recover from a false conviction. But I want to look at this and realize that false convictions, they don't come from not really understanding the question. The false conviction that she had actually comes from her own sinful desire. It's not the question itself. We all God asked questions. Jesus asked questions. So, it's not the question that is wrong itself, but where is the answer coming from? So, when she said added to it, it came from her own sinful desire. We we'll break this down, but I want to share a little story real quick. Um, and it's probably I would say one of the more embarrassings I've done in my disciplehip. So, if you can bear with me, when I was about a little under a year spiritually, there there's a brother. He's he's a little kooky. Um, but um he he was talking about this movie, this horror movie, and how it was like, you know, really horrific, really scarring, and he was really even tempted to say what movie it was because he didn't want me and another brother to watch it. But at the same time, he was like, \"But it's like there's nothing like it. Maybe you should, maybe you could.\" And so, he ended up telling us the movie. He recommended us to watch it. And we had no, he gave us no background. He's going to it clean. And then the worst part about it was that not only recommend this movie, but then he also said he doesn't want to watch it twice. So, he recommended the movie and then I left. And then it was just me and another brother watching this movie. And you know, sadly on my end, this is something I I I learned from a conversation with the brother afterwards um on what I did wrong. And but in the moment, I was stubborn. In the moment, like I operated off of what I believed was a sin. And because I was so stubborn, I didn't really want to work with other people's advice very often. So in towards the end of the movie, there's actually an extended uh nudity scene in the movie. And it's me and a brother watching and I chose not to skip it. And I gave all the excuses in the world why I believe I shouldn't have skipped this. I'm like, bro, it's a part of the art of the film. It's for this reason. It's for that reason, right? Uh, I hope people can relate to what I was saying, but but I made all these different excuses when the brother afterward who recommend the movie uh was saying, \"Bro, why did you not skip it? Like, what is wrong with you?\" And I'm like, \"Well, bro, because it is because I what what do you mean? Like, it's sin.\" Like, what are you talking about? What kind of excuse is that? And so, even though I was being stubborn, I'm so glad he stood his ground and said, \"I don't care what you have to say. That was sin.\" Like, that was wrong. And all of that. I remember what he said in the moment. He said, \"Malik, you should have skipped the movie. Sin is defined by the scriptures, not what you think it is.\" And then he asked me, \"How could not skipping it produced anything good?\" And then this is where it really got me. He said, \"Have you asked your brother what it produced in him?\" And I was spending all this time defending myself, what I believed was right. But I didn't think of the fruit that it produced. And it left me shocked. I'm like, wow. Like God has named certain sins by scripture and specifically states not to do certain things actually for our good. In all of this interaction, and we'll keep reading, we'll notice that Eve pays no attention to the fact that God didn't want her to eat it because she will die. And we'll define, you know, what the meaning of, you know, searching the guy means. But why did God not want her to eat it? Because it was good for her. And all of that was ignored. Why? Because she spent time talking to temptation, forgetting what is actually good for her. So, you know, I find that like Eve, you know, in my sinful nature, like I want to reason. I I want to, you know, point fingers. Why am I sinning? Well, it's actually their fault. Well, because they told me this. I was thinking this, all these different things. But really, it's I'm just trying to justify sin. I'm trying to justify why I think what I'm doing is right. And you know like Eve justifying uh you know you when you justify false convictions it's not coming from the question it's coming from your own evil desire your own sinful desire and what it produces is eating fruit that will cause you to die. What did I do in that moment? I I did one of the most wicked things that Jesus said you could ever do is create a stumbling block for your brother. But I was so caught up in justifying what I thought was right. Even trying to use other scriptures, which we know even Satan did. Satan tried to attempt Jesus to do certain things, even using other scriptures. And we do it constantly. This is the nature of sin. This is the first sin and it is revealing in all of us what happens at an inward level even before we sin. Right? In Genesis chapter 3, we'll keep reading in verse four. Let's see what Satan says. Says, \"No, you will certainly not die.\" The serpent said to the woman, \"In fact, God knows that when you eat it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\" The woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was there and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were open and they knew they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. So this is really important as we look at the rest of that that literally added to God's commands. But Satan being cunning and sly as he is, he tries to drift her focus from the command that she added to God's word and focus on the technicality of God's word. And what he literally does is he's like, \"Well, do you really know what God meant when he said you will certainly die?\" And part of what Satan was saying was true. And he's trying to play on her interpretation of it because it's not that, you know, you eat the fruit and you just drop dead on the floor, right? Like you physically die, but it's a different kind of death. And so, literally, Satan catches Eve on the technicality of God's word. It happens constantly, constantly. And you know, he's arguing that instead their eyes will be open and they will actually be like God. And once again playing on her desire to be like God, to create, to do all these wonders, to do all these miracles, and even it might even play on what she thinks is good. I'm doing a good thing. Doesn't God want me to be closer to him? Doesn't God want me to do these things? But God is, you know, but he's trying to, not God, but Satan is trying to twist your focus, not realizing that God knows what's best for you by catching you on a technicality. catching you on interpretation of his word. And what happened is yes, their eyes were opened. Their eyes literally saw it said that they saw that they were naked and that they covered themselves. And I find that this is very true. You know, the more we have the knowledge of God and we see the shameful acts that we do within ourselves. We see the shameful acts that is done around the world, the more we wish we had it saved. And it makes it's no wonder why they covered themselves because they say, \"Wow, look at me in my shame.\" But this is actually why and how they died. Because what died in that moment wasn't them physically. It was their innocence. They lost it. Once you lose your innocence, it could never be recovered. There there is no way. Once you do a sinful act, that is etched in history. But This is why it's so amazing to understand when God says as Travis said earlier that he forgives your iniquities that he no longer remembers like God is literally doing a supernatural act there something that we can't even fathom gaining our innocence back we died that moment but God says you know what I will remember it no longer so what did God say in the moment you will certainly die is they will lose their connection with him But what it was is because God wanted what was best for them. He didn't want them to see what was shameful. He didn't want them to lose their innocence. So in that way, they did die. And I find it powerful knowing what God does in his covenant today. Amen. But you know, I want to talk about, you know, Satan's response and look at an example of I find one of the most common ways this has played out and the fact that Satan was bringing up inter interpretation of what God meant when he said, \"You will certainly die while forgetting and not bringing up what Eve clearly added to God's word.\" You know, the the saying that people say by faith alone through grace alone. It's a phrase that is very commonly used, but let's let's look at it from this perspective. Let's look at it from comparing it to what's happening in this passage. Right? So the whatever someone talks about by uh grace alone through faith alone typically is uh they will use scriptures that mention both salvation and faith in the same verse or at least near each other, right? While at the same time they're trying to disprove baptism. They're trying to disprove o God's other commands. But it's really convenient not using passages on baptism to define baptism. instead looking at other passages on what salvation and faith really is. And it's actually quite powerful when you look at scriptures on faith and salvation because there's literally scriptures that say, you know, that women are saved through through childbearing. Explain that one to me. You know, there's scriptures that say that a believing spouse will save their unbelieving husbands. Explain. There's so much more context whenever just faith and salvation are brought together, right? But what happens it's all a root. It's the it's to forget the fact that uh through faith alone and grace alone is actually not in the Bible. It is simply added. And so instead like Satan, they are being caught on a technicality, caught on an interpretation. And it's quite powerful when you actually look at the comparison because once again the idea is that it's it is stemming from a sinful desire. Think of the combination of those passages. Obviously, the Bible doesn't negate itself. The Bible doesn't contradict itself. But, you know, we all want to hear, you know, I want to be saved. I want to have a great faith. I want to believe. Like, inspiring words. But look at the passages and the words around baptism. It says in Acts chapter 2, repent. That is, you know, even if you weren't even to narrow down that word baptism, look at the word repent. You have to change. You have to stop living the way that you're living. You know, another verse says that you are raised to a new life. Like literally, God says, \"Start from scratch. You you you messed up this one.\" You're right. Your your innocence your innocence is gone. You know, it can't be recovered. So, you have to start over again. You know, another passage says that you are baptized into his church. You know that, you know, it's all about this me culture. you know, me and me and my faith and, you know, my salvation or me. But God is saying, \"No, it's not about you anymore. It's about his church. It's about his body. It's about something so much bigger than yourselves.\" Another passage that is probably one of the more direct passages, it says that you have to pledge a clear conscience towards God. So now it's like, wait a minute, it's not just my actions that have to change. I can't just go to church. I can't just read my Bible. My entire mind has to be reset. what is going on here? And so you realize actually what is the true issue on the technicality? It's the sinful desire of the the issue of wanting to change to be different and they may not even realize it because they've been talking to Satan for so long. It's been an ongoing conversation. There's a reason why a lot of these beliefs are generations old and it's just so common. But you see in this passage that we cannot be conformed to the nature of sin. This has been happening since the very beginning. These same conversations with temptation. The same way that Satan tries to catch you, tries to get you to downplay his commands. He tries to get to catch you on technicality. He tries to make you add to God's word. It's the same thing that has been happening since the very beginning. It has not changed. And just like Eve, we cannot develop a false conviction that stems from a sinful desire. And what happens is when you do that, you know, it says that you disobey God's commands. Why? Because of the technicality. It's because of what does certainly die really mean? Not realizing that God doesn't want you to die. And it's quite powerful. And what happens is when you do that, you ignore the command of God that you just made up. It's not even real. It's some fake command of God that you just thought of in your minds. But where did it really come from? It was so that she could eat out of the tree in hope of being like God. So somewhere mixed in there, there might even be a little bit of good intention. Well, I do want to be like God. I do want to be different. But you completely disobeyed that completely ignored what he wanted in your life. And as we see then and as we see now, there is nothing new under the sun. It has been happening since the very beginning. So this is the nature of sin. This is what started the fall. It starts with a question aimed at what you're weak in. And then what happens is because of your weakness, you start to talk back to that temptation, talk back to Satan, and you answer it with a false conviction that is from your own inward desire because Satan got you. He hooked you. He targeted your weaknesses. And you answered according to your weaknesses. And then what happens is you downplay God's command. You focus on a technicality and then you ignore the fake command of God that you just made up. Why? Also, we can feed on our own desire. The first thing it says that Eve noticed about the fruit was that it was good. And that word good, it literally means beneficial. She believed it would benefit her. And that's where she fell. And I think if we were to rewind this whole situation and ask ourselves where did she first go wrong? What was the first misstep? So, okay, well, you see that God created the serpent, so God makes no mistake. You can't say that. Okay. Well, the serpent was in the garden in the garden. It's like, well, God didn't take it out of the garden, right? So, where did it actually go wrong? What was what was her first mistake? Her first mistake was talking back. That was the first mistake, letting it even stay a thought, letting it remain in her minds. And I find, you know, this happens very commonly, this this this sinful nature, the origin of the sinful nature. And it it it's all it reveals itself often. And you know, in all my time being a disciple, the amount of times that I have met somebody who has a sinful relationship, a sinful boyfriend, a sinful girlfriend, but they don't focus on, you know, them being in sin with them, them getting drunk with them, or them getting high or them sleeping with them. What they try to say is, \"Is baptism really real?\" Like, I don't I don't know about that, but is is happening since the beginning? You know, when someone is prideful and sometimes you actually show them that they're prideful and they see the scriptures, but what they try to get you with was like, well, like, how do I know smoking is a sin? Is that like really what God said? Can we define what smoking really means? What does it mean to get high? And it's a pattern. It is literally the pattern of sin. And it has been going on and on again. You know, often times maybe it's you love money. And so, it's no wonder you ask yourself, well, is it really a command of God? What is robbing me? What what does robbing God really mean? Well, what is contribution? How much am I supposed to give? It literally all stems from a sinful desire. It is the pattern that Satan has tricked mankind with. So, you know, of course, the question is then, how do we avoid it? H how do we go around it? Well, how do we make sure that we we're not caught in Satan's snare? Well, I have two extremely short points for you guys. Let's go to Jeremiah 17. the teacher. I preach in Jeremiah 17. Point number one, train your heart. In Jeremiah 17:9, it says, \"The heart is more deceitful than anything else and incurable. Who can understand it? I the Lord examine the heart. I examine the mind. I test the heart to give to each according to his way, according to what his actions deserve. So this passage is really powerful because it tells us, you know, when we have these thoughts that, you know, we can't give into it because the heart is deceitful. We we can't play with like, well, is this true? You know, I I remember a brother quoted he told me I've kept it as a quote to this day. I don't know if he made it up or not, but he said, if you talk to yourself, you will always be right. no matter what the outcome. If you think you're wrong, you're right. And if you think you're right, you're right because you thought of it. And so, you have to not let yourself do the talking. And it says here that, you know, I the Lord examine the mind. I test the heart. So, even though, you know, Satan is asking you questions, he's asking you these questions to make you make a mistake to focus on him. But it says that God also he damaged the mind. He also test the heart. So what does it mean to train the heart? You have to first accept that the trials will come. You have to realize that wait this temptation is targeting my weakness. This thought is targeting my weakness. This feeling that Satan has put on my mind on my heart is targeting my weakness right now of what I truly want to do. And let me you know train my heart to not give into that. Let me train my heart not to speak to that temptation. You have to train your hearts. And we cannot, you know, as it says here, we cannot be deceived by our own hearts. We have to be trained by God's word to train our hearts. Amen. And I find the most simple way to do this is point number two, go to Romans 12. But I think also um quick note as return to Romans 12 is uh I think when you when you start to think this way and understand that training your heart, it makes certain passages that might even seem slightly grim become actually beacons of light. Take for example um walking on the narrow road. It's like, oh, it's narrow. You can't trip. But I was thinking about it recently. I'm really glad it's not like a narrow dot that like if you make one mistake like you're done. You're you're clipped. You're done. And well, if you start to lean, you know, it's like you're gone, right? But it's actually a pathway. So God is actually not demanding immediate perfection of your heart. He wants you to walk with him and so you can train your hearts. Step by step, learn what it means not to speak to Satan. Not like the moment you speak to Satan, you're done. But like, no, you're learning how to train your hearts. And so it makes like, wow, like the narrow road, that's actually a pretty cool passage. like I can walk you know I don't have to stand in place and be concerned if I move an inch to the left or inch to the right I can walk and I'm walking with God but let's see how to train your heart in Romans 12 in verse one it says therefore brothers and sisters in view of the mercies of God I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to God this is your true worship do not be conformed to this age but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing and perfect will of God. Point number two quickly and simply is obey his word. You know it says that we are living sacrifices. What is that mean is we look to God and we say your word is my command sir. Like that is that is this and Eve's struggle wasn't realizing that she allowed herself to talk to Satan. It's like well like does death really mean that I instantly die? It's like let me not dig into that. Your word is my command, God. If if I die from it, I'm not going to do it. Simple. Period. Done. Like that. That That's how God wants to think. But once again, we're training our heart to think like that. You know, I'm I'm so glad it was mentioned how many of us sin today. That that happens. But it's a journey. It's a journey. We're learning not to talk to those temptations. Maybe you sin today, but don't let the same reason why you fell into that sin happen again tomorrow, happen again the next day. And we have to train our heart by obeying his word and by making ourselves a living sacrifice. And I believe when you do this, you start to see that God's word is good for you, that his commands are good for you. And I think it's really important for all of us to know this. All of us to know that God's word is good for us. Why, you know, do we deny oursel? It's good for us. Of course, we I think that's a basic one. We know that denying ourselves is good for us. But same thing, why do we share our faith? It's good for us. It's good for them, the person who, you know, is about to be with God, but it's good for us, too. Why Why are we Why are you making disciples? Why Why do I pour myself out? Why do I sacrifice my time to give to other people? It's good for me. I like it. When God says that it's better to give than to receive, he's not trying to convince you of something. He's trying to make you realize what he has put in your hearts, but it's hidden under all the other evil desires. And you want to train your hearts to get that out to realize that, you know what, I do like giving to people. I I don't want to just come to church. I want to encourage people. I I don't want to just share my faith. I want to make a disciple. I don't want to just stop sinning. I want to deny myself. I want to die to myself every single day. And so we have to realize the significance of obeying his word and then training our hearts as then not to be conformed by the sinful nature. Amen. So I just keep it simple, you know, don't downplay his word. Don't start looking into technicalities and all these different things. And it's okay to ask question. I'm not saying don't ask questions, but don't let it realize is it actually coming from your own evil desire? Is it coming from your own sinful nature? And so we have to train our hearts by learning to love to obey God's word and realizing that it's actually good for us. So let's obey his word. Let's train our hearts and let's not be conformed to the nature of sin to godly.",

    "summary": "The sermon, \"Do Not Be Conformed To The Nature of Sin,\" delves into Genesis 3 to illustrate how sin originates by questioning God's commands and engaging with temptation. Speaker Malik Speckman highlights Eve's mistakes: talking back to Satan, downplaying God's word, and adding to it, all stemming from sinful desires and a focus on technicalities. To counter this, the sermon provides two solutions: training one's heart to recognize and resist temptation, and wholeheartedly obeying God's word as a living sacrifice. The ultimate goal is to be transformed by the renewing of our minds, discerning God's will and realizing that His commands are for our good.",

        "insight": "This verse, featuring Satan's first words in the Bible, presents a closed-ended question designed to test Eve's commitment and expose any uncertainty about God's command. The speaker emphasizes that sin is often birthed from such questioning, where Satan subtly misquotes God to gain a foothold in our minds and lead us into temptation."

        "insight": "Contrasting Satan's misrepresentation, this verse reveals God's actual command, which begins with freedom (\"You are free to eat from any tree\") before stating a single prohibition. The sermon points out that a sinful nature tends to focus on the one rule, leading to doubts about true freedom and distrust in God's wisdom, rather than appreciating the abundance He provides."

        "verse": "Jeremiah 17:9",
        "insight": "This powerful verse, stating that 'The heart is more deceitful than anything else and incurable,' forms the basis for the first solution: training the heart. The speaker uses it to explain that we cannot rely on our own thoughts or feelings when tempted, as they are often deceptive. Instead, we must train our hearts through God's word to recognize and resist temptations that target our weaknesses."

      {
        "verse": "Romans 12:1-2",
        "insight": "These verses offer the second solution: obeying God's word and being transformed. Presenting our bodies as 'living sacrifices' means accepting God's word as our ultimate command, rather than questioning or dissecting it. The call to 'not be conformed to this age but be transformed by the renewing of your mind' signifies a complete mental reset and an ongoing journey of learning to discern and follow God's good, pleasing, and perfect will."

    "transcript": "I want to share a little bit about me and well what father's day means a bit for me. Uh when I uh was about two months old that was when my mother got baptized in this church. Wow. And at that moment she um was coming into the kingdom, leaving a marriage, but from being baptized, she wanted to now work on the marriage she was just about to leave. Um but sadly through that experience, it didn't end up working. So it left me and my my two siblings fatherless. But being in the kingdom, you know, kind of what Kyle was sharing a little bit, you know, my mother saw the importance of fatherhood. So, she talked to other men in the church and asked that they would come and, you know, play basketball with me, come throw the baseball with me, come play video games with me. And one of them, uh, maybe some of the older disciples know, his name was Scott Kendrick. Um, and he was a great father figure for me. And before they were dating, uh, the other one was is Luke Specman, uh, the man who of course is now my dad. And it started with just him just being a father figure before they even had an interest in each other. Um, and to me it was really special uh because you know my biological father he he left us uh with physical abuse, verbal abuse and left our family towards my mother before uh even before my uh younger sister was really even born. And I was really thinking about this uh hearing what Kyle was sharing and what I think many of us have even experienced is how much the the term father uh and how important that really means for society, how much no one really sees that importance. And I really want to go over some uh statistics that you see with fatherhood, specifically the lack thereof. And I think as we look at these statistics, I really want us to kind of reflect on how we are created in God's image and that the the meaning of a good father does come from God. And we see what happens when there aren't good fathers in our lives. Some of the statistics here is uh fatherless families are four times more likely to live in uh families more sorry let me read that. when you don't have a father in your family, you are four times more likely to live in poverty than you are uh with with one. So for married couples specifically um in comparison to families without a father, they are more likely four times more likely to be below the poverty line. It says that uh 84% of homeless families have no father presence. Wow. So, of all the homeless families, nearly 85% 84% of them have no father presence. 90% of homeless and runaway children come from fatherless homes. 90%. With kids on the streets, 90% of them come from fatherless homes. 63% of youth suicides come from fatherless homes. 63%. 85% of children with behavior disorders come from fatherless homes. 70% of juveniles in state rand institutions come from fatherless homes. And studying 75 different juvenile delinquents. 66 experienced fatherlessness. 20% never lived with their father. And 25% though they had fathers physically present had alcoholic fathers. So, even if you're physically there, it doesn't mean you're really there for your families. And these ones get a bit more uh heart-wrenching. Uh girls who feel close to their fathers are 75% less likely to have a teen pregnancy. One study shows that girls whose fathers left before they were five years old were eight times more likely to become pregnant as an adolescent. Eight times more likely. Uh the last one is one in four children today live without a father in their house. One in four children. And you know looking at these different statistics it it really paints a picture that we need fathers and not just fathers we need of course good fathers but not just you know thinking about uh the idea of fathers being with us but I think the picture that's painted amongst men is that men have to desire to lead right that men have to desire to be there for their families And right now the the world is not feeding that kind of thought amongst anybody. The desire to put other people above yourselves to be completely selfless. In fact, it's the complete opposite. The world says do you do what's right in front of you. But fathers, they don't do what's right in front of them. They seek the future of their family, the betterment of their family. And so today, we're going to talk about what it means to be a father. Let's go to Genesis chapter 5. In Genesis 5, this is a very interesting scripture actually. I really like this one. It's been shown to me many times. And in verse 21, it says, \"Enoch was 65 years old when he fathered Methuselah. And after he fathered Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and fathered other sons and daughters. So Enoch's life lasted 365 years. Enoch walked with God, then he was not there because God took him. Point number one, being a father makes you selfless. And I love this passage about Enoch because uh out of all the other men listed um from Noah's descendants uh sorry of uh Adam's descendants from Seth to Noah, Enoch had the shortest lifespan. You know, one thing about being a dad is you pour into your children so much. Sometimes it takes some years off of your life. Amen. Um and I'm kind of waiting for the gray hairs to kick in. Matt already saw a few back here, so we'll see. Um but you know out of all the other people listed you know you have Adam 930 years you had Enosh 95 years uh in verse 14 you have Kenan 910 years and then you have Enoch only 365 which in comparison is so small compared to the rest. However what he had was that he walked with God. But if you notice the moment when he walked with God was after he had his first child. You know, being a father, uh, it really puts you in the ringer of are you going to be filled with faith to lead your families. And you see the example here, even though his life was shortened literally and he didn't live as long as everyone else, you know, the Bible says better is one day in his courts than a thousand elsewhere. And that you really learn here, it's not about, you know, a long life or a self-gratifying life, but a life that walks with God. And I believe that, you know, when you uh are a a man leading your family in the way God has intended you, you are actually closer to God for it. And you know, we're going to study a little bit here of what exactly did Enoch learn that made him walk with God 300 years straight to the point where he didn't even experience death. That God just carried him along with him. Let's go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2. Being a father makes you selfless. In 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, the Bible reads in verse 11, \"As you know, like a father with his own children, we encouraged, comforted, and implored each one of you to walk worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.\" So, you know, I love this passage here because Paul is, you know, talking spiritually speaking to those who he mentored and to the church that he raised up. But he draws a comparison of fatherhood. Says, \"Like a father, we encouraged, comforted, and implored you.\" You know, I think that these things that, you know, fathers do uh is that they do just that. We talked last Sunday on what does it mean to encourage and it means to call others to your side as you head towards God. It says that fathers they comfort those around them and they implore they urge their families towards a better future. And I find really what it is is these two things combined. A father must desire what is honorable. And whenever you have a man in a position where he's about to be a father, but he doesn't actually desire what is honorable. He doesn't desire what is pleasing to those around him more than himself. That is why he is filled with fear instead of faith. It ends up making his family be a statistic. But it's so important for uh fathers or just honestly as we learn here, anyone desiring to help anybody desire what is honorable. And the second thing that a good father does is they are willing to put their family above themselves. And really what it is, it's being selfless. And if you think about that, desiring what is what is honorable, being selfless, those are not qualities that God just told men to have, those are qualities that he wants every single one of us to have. Being completely selfless and desiring what is honorable. And as you see here, even pleasing to God. And I believe this is actually what Enoch learned. He learned, you know, what it means to please God. And he learns what it what it meant to be selfless. And the reality is doing any of those things, it doesn't come naturally. It never comes naturally. We don't by photosynthesis learn how to have faith. You know, we we we can't just be around the setting and all of a sudden have great faith, learn how to leave and learn how to serve others. But it is through trial and error. It is through even more so the desire to want to do so. And I believe that is why we learn that Enoch was able to walk closely with God because now he's in the spot where he has to he has to be selfless. He has to desire what is honorable. And you know for all of us being in God's kingdom, we're given the same calling, you know, to encourage one another. And this aspect of fatherhood is once again not just given to men but every single one of us here to both sons and daughters of God. And you know, I I think if you really think about this, it says um he does this um he implores encourage and comforts like a father would so that each of you would walk worthy of God. Like think of that statement, walking worthy of God. It kind of hits home a little bit like what does that mean? Like we have to be worthy of God. What does what does that mean? Maybe we can reread it. Maybe there's a different way to to look over that passage. But no, it's to walk worthy of God. And I find the key to do so is we need people that we can look up to. I want you to think really deeply. This is how the spirit really works, guys. Kyle came up here and he gave one of the best communions I've ever heard. And I love what he said. He said in that moment when he was going through, you know, his own pity, he had Jack in his life of someone to look up to. We see the importance of even spiritual father figures. and and that we all need spiritual father figures. We need people that we can look up to, look up to their example, see how they're living, and ask if they could help direct us with, of course, his word. Amen. But I think even more so, not only do we have to uh find others like that in our life, but we have to be willing to do that for others as well. Yeah, I find that there are common fears that keep us from adopting this. Adopting both people that we can look up to as fathers, but then we ourselves pouring into others to help others walk worthy of God. You know, I find sometimes it's fear of failure. You know, no, you you fear pouring into somebody and it not working. pouring into somebody and maybe they walk away, maybe they fall away, you know, maybe there's a fear of uh letting someone down, being a disappointment, maybe you struggle with confessing your sin because you're so focused on pleasing people instead of pleasing God. But it's not about how the person sees you that you need uh the to look up to, but it's very specifically, you know, the idea that you you have to confess your sins. You have to get open and we all need advice. We all need direction. But then sometimes we get we because we want to be a spiritual son or daughter to somebody. We get uh we feel fear of disappointing somebody. Yeah. That even if I do, we have this great relationship. What if over the years I end up disappointing them? Um I find another fear uh that comes is we get fed a lie from Satan that we don't have what it takes. And so then we fear not being good enough to pour into people or we fear not being good enough to have someone pour into us. And I find these fears are very similar to the fears of the men who have left their families to be statistics. And so in the kingdom of God, I think sometimes we can even adopt these fears. We can adopt these fears and it's okay because we know God shows grace for us. But at the same time, God calls us not to leave our brothers and sisters at statistics to Satan. We have to actually help others as you see in this passage. But to do so, it requires being selfless. And it's not just for men aspiring to be fathers. It's for every single disciple. And that's why I believe Enoch is listed in the Hall of Faith. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 11. In Hebrews chapter 11, you know, we have a a passage here where the entire chapter it goes through one by one different men in the Old Testament and why they should be looked up to because of their faith. And then for Enoch in verse 5 of chapter 11, it says, \"By faith, Enoch was taken away. So he did not experience death. He was not to be found because God took him away. for before he was taken away, he was approved as one who pleased God. And it it's so it's so true, you know, of what what uh is what happens in our life. We could think that we're selfless. We could think that, you know, we know how to help people. We know how to put others above ourselves. But once you're in the position of being a father, that is really tested and seeing will you really do so. And it says here that uh Enoch specifically he was approved as one who pleased God. He it was is he really selfless? And when he became a father it was proved. Was he is he really capable of putting others above himself? And when he became a father it was proved. And what's amazing is that we see that Enoch was approved by God as someone who pleases him and walks with God because his faith was proven genuine. And so we learn once again this idea of us being created in God's image applies to all of us. That now because we're in God's kingdom, you have the chance to walk as close with God as Enoch did. as close with God as humanly possible for one reason because your faith is now being proved through you adopting God's you know mindset of helping others around you of having your faith being proved genuine and one thing is true is that it's not easy putting others above yourself is not easy is extremely challenging you know the idea of you know desiring all desiring what is pleasing to God. That's hard. Sometimes other desires, they creep in our hearts, you know, of a certain lifestyle, of a certain aesthetic because of what social media promotes. You know, we look at have this beautiful view. It's like maybe if I could live out there, right? But you know what's amazing is that people could live these long lives, but Enoch had the shortest life, but at the very end, he was with God. You know, it's not easy putting others above yourselves. you know, look looking at the disciples around you and you're like, you know what? How can I serve them? You know, I love what uh JFK says, you know, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. And it's a great quote because I think sometimes we're a part of something great and like I want great things to happen to me, right? But, you know, now that we're a part of something great, how can we make it even better? Through our own servitudes. And I think of course here that it's not easy to help others walk worthy of God. Once again, because of those fears, because of even seeing sometimes did not work out. But what's amazing is that, you know, no matter what happens, I love that it explained very simply what Enoch did. It didn't really say his trials or what he went through. It feels all good or it feels all bad. Just simply that he walked with God. And I love that even here for us. No matter what is happening in our lives, we can keep it simple out of choice of just choosing to walk with God. And you know what it means that we have to do it regardless of how we feel. And that's what it means to be a good father. That's what it means to be a good disciple is that we're not living based off of how we feel in the moment. We live off of loyalty to our father in heaven. Out of love for our father in heaven. You know, for me, you know, Nat will ask me, \"Hey, what do you think, you know, Anna's personality is gonna be like when she grows up? You know, what do you think she's gonna want to do?\" I'll be honest, I have no idea. And really, for what it is for me is that I have a hard time imagining that because I just want to keep Anna exactly how she is. You know, I want her to like, you know, the kind of what um, you know, we talk about that you could like, you know, punish and and help her because you want to refine her, but then she still comes running to you. And it's why it's like I love being the one that's always there for her. The one to help her, the one that help to help raise her up because there may be a point where she no longer wants that. And you know, it's the reality is is that I will still always be there for her. But it's the same thing with God for us. Imagine if God only loved you based off of how we felt. But the Bible says that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. So we know that God sets the perfect example that he loves us regardless of what he thinks about us, regardless of what we do. And so we have to show him that same love. Amen. Let's keep going. Let's go to uh say in Hebrews, go to Hebrews chapter 12. So let's always be selfless. Point number two is fathers understand discipline. Fathers understand discipline. Hebrews chapter 12 in verse three it says for consider him who endured such hostility from sinners against himself so that you won't grow weary and give up in struggling against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood and you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons my son do not take the Lord's discipline lightly or lose heart when you are reproved by him for the Lord disciplines the one he loves and punishes every son he receives endures suffering as discipline. God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? But if you are without discipline, which all receive, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Furthermore, we had human fathers discipline us and we respected them. Shouldn't we submit even more to the father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them. But he does it for our benefit so that we can share in his holiness. No discipline seems enjoyable at the time but painful. Later on, however, it yields a peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. You know, this passage is extremely powerful because you know the Bible says be transformed by the renewing of your minds. And here you really see God is trying to help us change how we view hardship. how we view suffering. But I find depending on how your parents treated you, you can read this passage in the wrong lens. Um, you know, the term is Jesus, uh, it's a term not just applied, uh, for reading the Bible, but for any text. It is the practice of interpreting a text by reading into it one's own ideas, assumptions or biases rather than drawing meaning out of the text based on its own contexts. So when you read this passage, no matter how the word suffering makes you feel, no matter how the word discipline makes you feel, what memories it brings up, let's read it according to how it wants us to learn from it. The opposite of is of Jesus is ex Jesus. And it literally means careful analysis and interpretation based on the author's intent and context. So, we're going to do our best to read it not with, you know, how we view discipline or how we view suffering, but how the Bible wants us to view suffering. Amen. You know, the Bible talks a lot about pain, a lot about suffering, a lot about hardship. And it's not just because, you know, now that you became a disciple, God just wants you to endure as much pain as humanly possible because as it says here, we all go through it no matter what. All of us go through suffering. You know, every now and then, you know, our our car might have some car troubles. You know, you you might be I I've had shoes that my shoes last very little amount of time. You know, I I'll typically notice when it's raining and all of a sudden it's it's a hard day of raining. I'm like, why are my socks sweating? What is happening? You know, or it could be a bad day because maybe there's a brother or a sister that you helped become a disciple and they shoot you a text saying, hey, I'm really struggling. I don't know if I want to continue. You know, we all endure hardship. But the Bible, it wants us to be refined by it. It wants to take it as discipline. And I think one thing that's powerful, it says we had human fathers that disciplined us. It says, \"And we respected them for us.\" Going back to the statistics that we looked at, a lot of people do not have fathers that they respect. A lot of people don't have fathers that actually disciplined that disciplined us for our own benefits. But as we see here, a godly father does so. And not only that, but God our father does so. And I love it because he does it in verse 10. So that we may share in his holiness. When you're enduring suffering as discipline, God is refining you that you may share in his holiness. There's a few quotes about parenting that I really enjoy. Uh one of them says, \"If you're going to make your kids tough, which they better be if they're going to survive in the world, you can't interfere when they're doing a dangerous thing carefully. And this concept is letting you know your children understand pain, understand what happens when they fail, when they get hurt, you know, uh to certain extent. Obviously, you don't want too bad of an injury. Amen. But they have to experience that. And that if you guard your children from experiencing pain and hardship, then they're going to experience it later when you're not around. And I'm sure you've known adults 20, 25, 30, if not more, where they're throwing temper tantrums. Is because they were guarded from pain when they never should have been. You know, and there's another quote I really like. It says, \"Parenting is not about raising children. It's about raising adults.\" And it's this concept of, you know, you know, you're parenting your child not so they can be good children in society, but so they can be good adults in society. And you're literally as the father or mother starting from scratch. You're the one trying to instill the the lessons, instill the convictions. And the Bible says that, you know, teach your children in the way that they should go so that they will not depart from it. And it almost sounds crazy of a concept because, you know, like, you know, children are rebellious. You know, they just want to do whatever they want. Even when you get older, you I'm I'm going to be better than my parents, you know, whatever it is. But I think it's good because you want your children to be better than you. But you can only instill convictions on how to do so, the right ways and the wrong ways at a early age. So for us, God is parenting us. God is helping us so that we may share in his holiness when we grow into full maturity. Let's go to Romans chapter 5. Romans chapter 5. And uh I appreciate Noah for uh sharing the scripture earlier, you know. One spirit. Romans 5 in verse two says, \"We have also obtained access through him by faith into this grace in which we stand. And we boast in the hope of the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our afflictions because we know that affliction produces endurance. Endurance produces proven character. And proven character produces hope. You know, I I love this passage because hope of going to heaven is tied with proven character. And proven character is tied with endurance. And endurance is tied with affliction. And that in order for us to take uh great honor and boast in going to heaven is when we realize that God is uh refining us through our affliction. And then that is why we take joy in our hope because we take joy in our affliction. Amen. And I think we have to really change the way we view hardship, the way we go through struggles. You know, it's only a bad day if you view it that way. and that it can be a day that could be troublesome, but God is refining you. He's helping mature you that you may share as holy holiness. Let's go to First Peter chapter 1. We'll close out here. 1 Peter chapter 1 it says in verse 6 very similarly it says you rejoice in this even though now for a short time if necessary you suffer grief in various trials so that the proven character of your faith more valuable than gold which though perishable is refined by fire may result in praise glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ once again you see this concept of proven character and we take joy in our affliction. And that's why I believe, you know, we started off with looking at Enoch, how he was able to walk with God. You know, he saw the trial of what it meant to be selfless. The trial of what it meant to put others above himself. And he might have thought he was somewhat selfless before. He knew how to do that. But now it was really put to the test when he had a family to honor above his own life. And that what you saw was the proven character of his faith. You saw that that what he believed that was he really selfless, was he really able to put other above himself? It was proven when he had children. I'm not sure why I keep doing it, man. Amen. I'm glad you guys can hear me. I'll just speak louder if he does it again. But know this concept of, you know, we might have convictions, but it is really put to the test when we go through affliction. And not only is it that, you know, fathers must understand discipline, but of course, we as children of God must understand discipline. And I think what we really have to do is view it in a completely different light. View any sort of trial. I like what it says here. It says, \"Though you suffer grief,\" and it's not even just the trial itself, but even the emotions behind it, the grief behind it, the sorrow behind it. God is saying, \"You know what? You can change the way you view it because I am refining you. And you know it says that you know we used to respect our fathers. If we had good fathers who helped refine us, how much more so should we show respect, honor and glory to God who refineses us. And so I think you know on this day of father's day you know maybe we might have had good fathers and I think according to the statistics I think many of us might have had not very good fathers maybe even absent fathers but regardless we still have a father who is trying to mature us. There is still someone looking at you and wanting what is what's best for you. Yeah. You know, I love the concept of discipline because let's say you put your child through piano classes, through gymnastic classes, through sports classes, all these different things, they hate it. They just want to play video games. They just want to run around, do whatever they want to do. But, you know, once they grow older, it gives them opportunities. You know what happens when we're disciplined? We get the opportunity to be with God. And that's the only way we can be with God is when we're refined by his discipline. So let us understand what what discipline is because God created for all of us. And even if you don't have a good father, he will be your father. And let us also learn what it means to be selfless. And that is not just a trait for men aspiring to be fathers, but it's for every single child of God who is looking to encourage those around them. So, happy Father's Day.",

Speaker Malik Speckman outlines two key characteristics: selflessness and understanding discipline. He argues that true fathers desire what is honorable, put others above themselves, and embrace God's refining discipline to develop proven character and share in His holiness. The message extends to all disciples, calling them to live selflessly, embrace trials as opportunities for growth, and serve as spiritual mentors to help others walk worthy of God.",

    "transcript": "Please go to Hebrews chapter 3. I will say quickly before we start uh the keep uh Anthony in your prayers. he's going through open heart surgery this week and that they that they said that he was literally a ticking time off, but they found uh the solution and and he came into the hospital early enough off of simple chest pains and now that he is on the way to recovery. So, please pray for a surgery. And then uh Hebrews chapter 3, we're going to go right into it. I've been thinking a lot about um I think just the power of the kingdom. Like do do we really believe that there is power in us gathering right here? I is there power when you sing to God? The the power when you have your quiet times power when you're praying when you're sharing your faith. And I think that it's so easy for us to forget about that. how much God works through all of these situations. How much God works through each and every one of us. And I find that what it really is is we need to constantly be reminded of it. We need to constantly hear it over and over again. No one is so strong that they don't need a reminder on what they'll always do, right? And I think God built us all that way. you know, we're not so strong after, you know, drinking gallons of gallons of water that we no longer need water. You you can go to a buffet, you know, somehow pay for the whole day, eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and never leave, and you'll still be hungry tomorrow. Like, we are built in a way to constantly be needing exactly what we need to live. You know, my my title for us today is the meaning of encouragements. We're going to look at the meaning and significance of encouragement today. And in Hebrews chapter 3, it says in verse 7 says, \"Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion on the day of testing in the wilderness where your ancestors tested me, tried me, and sought my works for 40 years. Therefore I was provoked to anger with that generation and said they always go astray in their hearts and they have not known my ways. So I swore in my anger they will not enter my rests. Watch out brothers and sisters so that there won't be in any of you an evil unbelieving hearts that turns away from the living God. But encourage each other daily while it is still called today. So that none of you is hardened by sin's deception. For we have become participants in Christ if we hold firmly until the end uh until the end the reality that we had at the starts. You know, I love this passage. It starts with a psalm. It's the psalm of David. And the Psalm of David is referencing what happens in Exodus 16 of how God's people, they rebelled constantly against him. And what they would do is they would complain to Moses. They would complain to Aaron and they would always blame other people for their current situation. But meanwhile, God was testing them. But what they did, they turned it right back to God and they tested God's patience. And so that's what it's talking about here. And there's a warning that Paul gives in this letter of not to fall into that same temptation of wandering the wilderness and giving into unbelief, giving into sin. And I love the solution that he has for unbelief. That the solution is encouragement. That when you're struggling with unbelief, with wickedness and sin in your heart, it says, \"But encourage one another. and and is not even watching out for the wickedness and unbelief in yourself but amongst your brothers and sisters. And the solution is encouragements. You know encouragement in the Greek is paraco and parah means besides or near and cleo means to call. Encouragement literally means to call someone near to you. to call someone beside you and that you see your brother or sister struggling in unbelief and you say, \"Hey, come join me. Co come stand right next to me. Come worship God with me. Come share come share your uh your faith with me. Come have a quiet time with me.\" And you're encouraging each other, you know, and literally it's you're calling people to your side and you speak in a way of comfort, in a way of instruction, in a way to admonish them and even to strengthen them. whatever it takes to worship together, to call to one side, you know, and I find that encouraging brings us closer to God. And then, of course, it brings us closer to one another. That's the point of encouragements. And the closer you get to your brothers and sisters, the closer that you get to God, the farther you get from yourselves. And that if you're being encouraged, it means someone is calling you to their side. That literally means you have to leave where you're currently at. And I find that's why it says right after this it says um for it says uh to not be hardened by sin's deception that when someone is hardened their heart is hard and they're prideful encouragement is taken offensively because they realize I don't want to do what you're doing. I like where I'm at right now. And so encouragement even though it's good depending on your heart it feels terrible because you have a hard heart. You have prideful hearts and you know encouragement is needed because it is the solution to unbelief. God has used it as the solution. He uses each and every one of us to encourage one another to not give in to unbelief. See godly encouragement. It is the solution to a sinful unbelieving heart and is the enemy to a prideful one. We need encouragements and you know it goes back to this passage. It references very specifically the Israelites leaving Egypt, the Exodus. And I find it quite significant because if I were to think of the amount of people who were encouraging during the Exodus, you can count on one hands. You have Joshua, you have Caleb, sometimes you had Aaron, and most of the time you had Moses. But even Moses and Aaron didn't even make it. And so out of two million people who originally left that they kept giving into unbelief except for two men who never did it, Joshua and Caleb. So two out of the two million original people that left Egypt went into the promised lands that God used the 40 years of testing them to raise up another generation. And so literally we learn from this passage the power of encouragements that if only God's people back then when leaving Egypt had more encouragers. How many more would have made it? I imagine if go if just maybe a handful more. Maybe 10 more. Maybe 20 more. How many more would make it to the promised land if instead of giving into unbelief, brother and sister called each other to their side, saying, \"No, that's not the way. This is the way. Come to come by my side. Worship God with me.\" You know, I think um you know, we're here right now uh because we know how much it means to encourage one another and that we have to put and be willing to put God first and even other people above ourselves. You know, since encouragement is calling others to leave their post, sometimes, you know, for them it's going to be uncomfortable to do so. And so encouragement though objectively it is good sometimes for the other party or even yourself if you feel awkward sometimes it hurts. But the whole point is to be close to God. You know as disciples we need encouragement. We need encouragements because when we're not being called by other disciples to be close to them and to be close to God instead we hear the calling from the world. You know, I find that there are five things that the world typically will call us with. You know, I think number one, the world says to follow your hearts. Follow your hearts. That what whatever feels right, as long as it is in your mind and you feel that it is true, just follow it. You know, but the Bible in Jeremiah 17:9 says, \"The heart is deceitful above all things and it is desperately sick.\" And then it ends with a question, who can understand it? And I love the question because it doesn't say absolutely no one can understand it, but it's an open-ended question to reveal that Jesus can understand it, that God can understand it, that yes, none of us could really understand why do we desire the flesh, but God knows and he gives us a solution. You know, I find the second thing that the world calls us with is to be true to yourself. be true to yourself. You know, Jesus says, \"I am the way, I am the truth, and I am the life.\" And that if anything, he doesn't say be true to yourself. He says to deny yourself. The complete opposite of what the world calls us with, you know. Uh, another one is to believe in yourself. And I find this is a very common one for many of us because it's so hard looking at the world. Many people come up with the solution not to look outwardly and in a sense they're trying to find a spiritual solution to not giving into what other people are doing. But the solution instead of looking to God, it looks to themselves. And Jesus says, \"Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me.\" And what instead of putting hope in yourself and what you can do and desiring your own control, he reassures them that says, you know, God has prepared a place for you and I've gone to make sure that it is ready. That you no longer believe in yourself, but you put your hope in Jesus. You know, the fourth thing I think the world calls us with is to live your truth. You know that if as long as you live according to the teachings that you believed is okay, then that is okay because truth is subjective anyways. It's not how people believe that. But we know that that's not how the world works. You know, Jesus says that if you hold to my teachings and you're truly my disciples, then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free. And I think what it is is the world calls us with all these different sayings and phrases that seem meaningful and they seem right, but they will never make you free. But Jesus has it all waiting for you. And I find the last one that the world calls us with is that it constantly tells you, \"We'll do whatever you want as long as you're happy.\" As long as you feel happy. You know, and Jesus never said that. He says, \"What good is it if you gain the whole world but lose and forfeit your very soul?\" And these lies that we're constantly told to by the world, it is calling us. And in a way, the world is trying to mimic encouragements, calling us to its side. But we have to be encouraged by our brothers and sisters being called to God's side. And we can all relate. All of us from time to time will hear the calling from the world. But we have to choose not to leave the small and narrow and you know and turning to the world and go on the broad, the wide and the easy. We have to be encouraged to stay on the small and narrow path because when you're on the broad, the wide, and the easy, in Matthew 7, it says at the end is destruction. And at the end of the path is destruction, but on the way there, it's all about you. We have to be careful not to give into the calling of the world, but be called by encouragements. So I want you guys to realize that when you encourage somebody, when you call someone to your side, that is the power that God has given you as a disciple to keep someone from following the broad and wide road that when you encourage somebody, when you do exactly what the Bible says and you call them near to you to obey God with you, to worship God with you, to have zeal for God with you, you're keeping them from destruction. There is power in encouragements. And I think that we need to see here in Tampa, we need to see how much we need one another. You know, it's not a sacrifice to make time for one another. I I believe making time for one another is a sanctuary. That it's not painful to make time for one another, but in fact, making time for one another eases that pain. Why? If we do it according to the Bible and we encourage one another, you know, it costs me nothing. You know, if if my arm and my maybe my other arm gets cut off in order to save my family, it cost me nothing. If it cost me an arm and a leg, if it cost me my sights, if it cost me my smelling in order to save my family, it cost me nothing because of how valuable my family is. And so it's the same thing making time as Chris was sharing sacrificing for the kingdom cost you nothing because of what you get in the ends and also we need to uh always be building one another up. Let's go to Ephesians chapter 4. I have two points for us in Ephesians chapter 4. It says in verse 15, but speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into him who is the head, Christ. From him the whole body fitted in it together, the whole body uh by every supporting ligament promotes the growth of the body for building itself up in love by the proper working of each individual part. Point number one is that love builds up. Love builds up. And I love this passage because it talks about uh that we are working uh in love for the body and that the goal is to grow up in Christ. In other passages, we learn that Christ is the head of the church and we are the body. You know, we do not want a arm or a foot that acts completely on its own. What would happen if you're trying to go one way and all of a sudden your foot just, you know, you're trying, it just goes that way, you know, and I'm going this way. Why is my leg going that way? Because we want our whole body to be in unison with what's going on up here. You know, we're supposed to be in unison with Christ the head. And it talks about how we even do that. It literally says that Christ says he promotes the growth of the body for building itself up in love by it says how the proper working of each individual parts. See when we work together in love we are working to build unity with one each other with one another and the with the whole goal of being in unison with Christ. So it's like, you know, as we're working to love one another, as we're working to serve one another, it's not just to, you know, to their end, to what what pleases their needs, but it literally gets us closer to Christ. You know, think of it this way. If, uh, you know, you want to serve and love a person, but you only do it according to how you want to serve and love them, and you say, \"Well, I love you. I love you very much. You know, here's my favorite pen.\" It's like, \"Well, I don't like writing a pen. and I like writing in pencils. Well, it doesn't matter how genuine that thought was, but if it doesn't actually serve them, then it's it's pointless. We have to build one another up. And you know, I was thinking of the story the story of this man and he uh he it looks like he's being crushed by a giant washing machine that he's trying to get down the steps of his house. And so it's literally on his back and it's like, \"Oh, oh no, it's about he's about to get crushed.\" So, a man comes on by and he sees what's happening and he goes in on the other side and he observed that the man's trying to get it out of his house. So, he starts pushing, but he's trying to guide it, you know, to, hey, we'll help you get it out. I'll make sure it doesn't crush you. And so, for hours and hours and hours and they're sweating and sweating, you know, uh, they keep going and finally they take a break. And after this break, the man who was originally there says, \"We're never gonna get this thing in the house.\" And then the other man is like, \"Wait a minute. I thought we were trying to get it out of the house.\" And you know, this man was urgent. He was caring. He was loving. He showed action, but he was doing the wrong thing. You know, I think as husbands, we can share this sentiment. We have all the mighty wisdom in the world, all the knowledge, all the great advice to help anything our wives are going through. But if it's not helpful and if my advice doesn't help her, I have because I love her, I will find what actually helps her. And that what's the point is that we're building each other up. You know, I think, you know, sometimes what it is is that we want to love people how we want to love them. We want to serve people how we want to serve them. But love, help, and encouragement isn't defined by the giver. It's defined by the receiver. And so, if we're going to build one another up, we have to actually think about how is this going to help them? Is the way I'm saying it encouraging? And it's not about does it feel good? Encouragement is not about what feels good in the moments. It's going to feel good and it might often times feel very bad, but the whole point does it build you up to Christ. That is the goal. And so I find that we have to actually think what will actually help this person. How can I build them up to Christ? Let's go to first Peter chapter 4. 1 Peter chapter 4. So point number one, love builds up. We have to actually define encouragement by the person that's receiving it. Point number two, love shows up. 1 Peter 4 and verse 7, it says, \"The end of all things is near. Therefore, be alert and sober minded for prayer. Above all, maintain constant love for one another since love covers a multitude of sins.\" You know this passage is very similar to what we read in Hebrews. We just read that to help someone from a wicked, sinful, unbelieving heart. It says to encourage one another. And then very similarly, it literally says that maintain love for one another because love covers a multitude of sins. Once again, we see the power of encouragements, the power of love for one another. And I love this passage because it talks about uh being alert and sober minded for prayer. And we know how significant praying is. But then it says in the next verse, above all, even above prayer, maintain love for one another. But the verse starts in verse seven with the end of all things is near. So we learn in this passage that where there is no urgency, there is no love. And that, you know, when we see how an urgency, when the end of all things is near, you realize how valuable things are. You realize how valuable people are, how valuable the kingdom is. And so it's like whenever you have this urgency and you have this value and you value the kingdom according to how God values the kingdom, you put that love above everything. You know, I love this passage and I think sometimes, you know, we're able we're we're unable to come to a service. We're unable to come to midweek. I know exactly what that's like being really sick. Maybe it's even because of a desire. You know, I've had weeks where I've gone just doing my best, sharing my faith, nothing's happening. Sunday morning, 6:00 a.m., I'm not going. And those thoughts, those waves, it'll overcome me. But I I think it's important to really look at this is that it's encouragement that gets you out of those slumps. That it's when you actually go to that Bible study, when you go to church, and maybe you are feeling that type of way. All of a sudden, you're like, \"This is awesome. But it only happens when you give your hearts. And you give your hearts because another brother or sister is calling you to do so to do so with them. And so that's why we need to encourage one another. You know, and you know, like I said, sometimes you're unable to come to something, whether it be you're on a family vacation, you know, you're sick or you're injured. you know, we visited Anthony in the hospital over the weekend and he's like, \"Bro, you know, I don't think I'm going to make it to service this Sunday.\" I was I was like, \"Yeah, you think, you know, but um he's like, \"Yeah, so I'm why even why is this even a topic of conversation? Of course you're not of course you're not coming to service a Sunday.\" Um but you know, sometimes things happen and we're not condemned because we miss. And it's not about what's what's happening. It's not about what happened that's the issue. It's about what's going on in here. And when ask yourself whenever you miss a meeting of the body, ask yourself, you know, do I really value God's people the way that he values them? Because things happen time to time and God is gracious. But it says in Hebrews chapter 4 that he judges the thoughts and intentions of the hearts. Let's go there real quick. Hebrews 4. Let's take a quick peek. Hebrews 4. It says um in verse 12, \"For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating as far as a separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the hearts. No creature is hidden from him, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an accounts.\" And I find that, you know, whatever happens literally is not what actually matters, but it's about what's going on in here. What is the intention? What is the thoughts? We all miss from time to time, but why are we missing? You know, I think it's important to realize that love does show up. And then sometimes when you don't show up, you know, that's when people say, \"I'm in there in spirit.\" You know, I I'll be there in spirit. Why? Because I do love you guys, you know. So, let's always realize that love shows up, but it shows up here first. Let's go to Luke chapter 11 and we'll close out here. Sometimes I write extra verses in there just to see if I have to use them. But, no, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. We'll close out here. In verse 31, the Bible reads, \"The queen of the south will rise up at judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon.\" And look, something greater than Solomon is here. The men of Nineveh will stand up at judgment with this generation and condemn it because they repented at Jonah's preaching. And look, something greater than Jonah is here. See, don't let anyone fool you. The greatest thing that could ever happen in your life is being a part of the kingdom of God. There is nothing more incredible, nothing more powerful, nothing more encouraging than taking part of the kingdom of God. And it's something that Moses didn't even have. As we read earlier, it's something that Solomon didn't have. It's something that not even Jonah or any other prophet had. It is the word of God in their hands and written in their hearts. And it gives them the power to encourage one another. It no longer lies in a singular leader. It no longer lies in a few handful of prophets. It lies with every single one of us. And that those same prophets, those same leaders that God literally spoke to to encourage them, don't go down the road, don't go down destruction, but follow God. We have that same power right now. So, let us realize how great this is. Let us actually use it. Let's encourage one another. Let let us use love to build each other up and not according to how we want to build someone up, but what actually helps them reach unity with Christ. And let us realize that love always shows up, but it first shows up here. We don't come here because we're told to or because we have to, but because we value this more than anything else in the world. So, let's always encourage one another. To God be the Lord.",

    "summary": "This sermon explores the meaning and power of encouragement, drawing extensively from Hebrews 3. It defines encouragement as 'calling someone near' to God and to one another, presenting it as the divine solution to unbelief and hardening of the heart. The speaker contrasts this godly encouragement with the world's deceptive calls to self-reliance and subjective truth, which ultimately lead to destruction. The message concludes by emphasizing that true love builds up others by meeting their actual needs and shows up with urgency, reflecting the immense value God places on His people and kingdom.",

And I want to talk about, you know, my my week so far, but I want to ask you guys about your guys' week. Who would say they've had an absolutely stellar, amazing, out ofthe- park week? Nothing bad happened and they're just so excited right now. We have Cassidy, we have Austin. Okay, we have Okay. Who who would say it's not about having a bad week, but who would say they've had this week be, you know, it was a massive learning opportunity? I I would say that would be me. Okay, man. You know, that's most of us. I would say for me it was a big learning opportunity. Amen. And I would say what God has been teaching me this week, I really want to uh lift up Megan for her communion. And um I should have just gave her the Bible and just give her 10 more minutes. Have her be up here. But um but I would say what God has been teaching me this past week would be surrender. Come on, brother. Surrendering. You know that I I cannot prevent bad things from happening. I I cannot, you know, keep people that do what I believe what could be best for them. I I cannot make anyone do anything. I cannot you know control outcomes or circumstances and that you know whatever you know temptations whatever feelings that like am I really in control? No. Surrender. Y and you know often times you know because of my own sinful nature I think well could I be in control? If only I was wiser maybe I could be more in control. Wow. If only I had a longer quiet time, maybe I'd have a better day today. If only I prayed for more hours, maybe this bad thing wouldn't have happened. If only I did the A, then maybe B wouldn't have happened, and therefore I wouldn't feel like C. Surrender. And these thoughts, they've they've been ringing in my head of where are my weaknesses and what do I have to constantly do to make up for it? And instead of focusing on God's gifts in my life, I focus on my weaknesses. And it causes me to think, you know, how can I make up for it? And uh Saturday morning, yesterday, uh I woke up a little bit later than I would have liked. My plan was to wake up at a certain time so I can go and help uh Asia and Deja move. And I thought they're moving at 9:00, but they moved at 10:00. And so I woke up, okay, I woke up a little bit later. Okay, I'm trying to read as much as I can before Anna wakes up and before I have to take care of her before I leave. But since I woke up a bit later, my window for having my quiet time was shortened cuz I heard Anna cry. I'm like, \"Oh man, I got got to go help her.\" And so I go and I I go and help her. Um and usually like she has a hard time like eating her food instantly. She just wants to play around. She's like, \"What can I do? What can I do?\" But but when I got her, we I went to the office. I'm like, \"Okay, I'm going to read a little bit before she's hungry.\" But instantly, she's saying, \"Daddy, eat the food.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" So, I closed the Bible. I didn't get a chance to read. I went to go and get her food. And I realized that, oh man, I I left some dishes in the sink as well. So, I have to before I can make her food, I have to do all do the dishes. And then I then I make her food. And then once she's done eating, then maybe I can have my quiet time before I leave to go help the sisters move. But then I thought to myself, will I even have enough time to do this? But because of my, you know, desire for control and, you know, my own sinful nature, I thought to myself, if I don't have my quiet time before I leave, what happens if someone asks me about it? And then I'm thinking, I'm like, wait a minute. Like, if I don't want to be caught as, you know, I'm here preaching on Sunday. Hey, how's it? What did you read this morning and and then feel embarrassed because of my own lack of discipline of waking up early enough? And then that goes back to my sinful nature, my desire for control, and even the desire to even people please. I was like, whoa, come on, bro. This is where I'm at right now. right now what what I'm fearing is embarrassment rather than the desire to be close to God. And I I've been thinking these thoughts and really, you know, how much I need to overcome. And then I look back at Anna and she has these huge brown eyes. And it's really funny when her uh when she was smaller even, her eyes were the same size. And so like you know how children are really really honest. Every time a child would pass by like wow she has really big eyes and and she would I have pictures you can ask me for after service. She would stare like this like almost like there was like something like just constantly like like I'm like do you blink? You okay? But she has these big, you know, brown eyes and she makes these, you know, funny facial expressions. And then for a brief moment, I felt yesterday morning like all of those thoughts of, you know, desire for control, you know, whether it be insecurity, you know, will I am I really strong enough, they all went away. Just vanished. Amen. And there's one singular thought I had looking at Anna was that I would die for her. And for a moment it's like, you know, a giant white canvas with a single phrase, I would die for you. And I was thinking that and thinking about my own troubles and worries and struggles. I'm like, wow, I wonder if God views me the same way. Wow. just looks at me and like Anna, Anna's done nothing for me. She's giving me dirty diapers. She's giving me a bad attitude. She's entering her terrible tooth. So now she's throwing tantrums. And you know, she leaves messes for, you know, me to clean up. And yet I look at her and all I can think is that I would die for her and break this mic for her. [Laughter] But I would do anything for her. Amen. If if any enemy or danger faced her that I would do whatever it takes to come out on top to protect her. Yeah. And yet she has done nothing for me. That is us with God. That's right. There isn't anything that we could possibly give to God. That's right. He already loves you so much. In Isaiah chapter 63, You know, in even thinking about that topic, there's nothing that we could give to him that he hasn't already given us. Therefore, there is something that we could take from him, and that is our love for him. Amen. You know, I could desire to give Anna the world, but if she disowns me, there is no way I can put it in her hands. Right? And so, though we can't literally give anything to God, he hasn't already given us. Therefore, the only thing we could take from him is our love for him. In Isaiah 63 in verse 15, All right. My title is once again, what could we possibly give to God? In verse 15, Isaiah 63 says, \"Look down from heaven and see from your lofty home.\" This is Israel's prayer to God. Holy and beautiful, where is your zeal and your might, your yearning, and your compassion are withheld from me. So, at this moment, Israel, they're facing the consequences of their sin. And you hear this prayer to God say, \"God, don't you see the trouble I'm in? Don't you see what I'm struggling with? Don't you see all this hardship surrounding me?\" And it feels like just like this prayer for us even of God, where are you? And if you continue reading, it says, \"Yet you are our father.\" Even though Abraham does not know us and Israel doesn't recognize us, you Lord are our father. Your name is our redeemer from ancient times. Why, Lord, do you make us stray from your ways? You harden our hearts so that we do not fear you. Return because of your servants, the tribes of your heritage. You know, I think we can relate so much to this passage. And here's what it's simply saying. God, look at my hardships. Look at my struggles. Look at my weaknesses. Why have you made me this way? And it's this anger towards God if you've hardened my heart. Yeah, God, I am so weak and yet you've given me these trials. Am I really able to overcome? Did you really make me strong enough? But I find the question isn't am I strong enough? Cuz we can never do it on our own. The question is, are we willing? Cuz are you able? Absolutely not. That's why you need God. That's right. So the better question is, are you willing? Let's go to Luke chapter 15. And in this same way, you know, there's nothing that we could give to God, but there's one thing we could take, and that is our love for him. You know, sometimes in, you know, our disciplehip, we hit a moment where we realize that even though there's nothing I can give to you, there is one thing that I could take from you. God, I want you to give to me. What What can I gain from you? And it goes from doing our best to work for God instead of the desire to be with God. And what happens is, you know, we we do all this searching and searching of what does it take? What does it take? How can I make up for my weaknesses and we're frantically searching for a way to God to be with us? But if you're a disciple, God, the Holy Spirit's already inside of you. It can't get any closer than that. Yeah. And so what it is is you're you're frantically trying your best to have something that God has already given you. And we're going to talk about that today. And instead of thinking of what can God give to me, because he's not giving you anything you haven't already had, he's not giving you anything that you actually already lost before. He's giving you back your innocence. He's giving you back the love that he had for you when he originally created you, when you were an innocent child. And Luke chapter 15, I have two points for us. Come on, bro. We'll talk about the prodical son. And for the first point, and we'll skip the beginning a little bit, but we know that the son took the inheritance from his father and squandered it on reckless and wild living. And we're going to look at the decision he came to toward the end. In Luke 15:1 17, the Bible reads, \"When he came to his senses, he said,\"How many of my father's hired workers have more than enough uh food, and here I am dying of hunger. I'll get up, go to my father, and say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired workers.\" So he got up and went to his father. But while the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran, threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. The son said to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\" Point number one, for for us to return to God, for us to stop thinking of what can God give to me? Almost like we're ex putting expectations on God. Number one starts with how you view yourself. Point number one, how do you view yourself? You know this son, he squandered his father's inheritance and he came to the conclusion that I am an unworthy son. That if I were to go back, I should be a slave in his household. there is no reason for me to be considered a son because I've ruined what he's given me. So this son, he viewed himself quite literally as someone who should be a slave. That going back to his father that he does not deserve the status of sunship, that I should be a slave in his household. But we're also going to take a deeper look at how the other son viewed himself. In verse 25, the Bible reads, \"Now his older son was in the field. As he came near the house, he uh heard music and dancing. So he summoned one of the servants servants questioning what these things meant.\" \"Your brother is here,\" he told them, \"and your father has slaughtered the fats and calf because he has him back safe and sound.\" Then he became angry and didn't want to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him be but he replied to his father look I have been slaving many years for you and I have never disobeyed your orders yet you never gave me a goat so I can celebrate my friends. Uh but when this son of yours came who has devoured your assets with prostitutes you slaughtered the fat and calf for him. Son, he said to him you are always with me and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found. You see, this older son thought very differently of himself. The the previous son lost his sunship in his own eyes. He said, \"You know what? I deserve to be a slave.\" But the other son, looking at his brother and hearing the celebration, looks at his hands cuz where is he found? He's found in the fields. So he looks at his labor and he's like, \"You know what? I deserve to be a son.\" The complete opposite of his brother. And it's quite sad cuz he's saying that son of his should be a slave. And then uh me as the slave, I should be the son. I should be the one celebrating in there. Why am I doing all the hard labor and I look like a slave? He squandered everything and he looks like the proper son. And we get into this mode of comparison. Yeah. We we get into this way of thinking of, you know, thinking that we deserve more than what we have right now. And you know, how you view yourself, you know, when it's time to be with God and celebrate with him, how you view yourself, just like the situation will determine whether you're inside celebrating or you're outside angry and bitter. and mad at God. And when you're willing to be a slave, God will treat you as a son. But when you are working hard to be treated as a son, you will only view yourself as a slave. See, this son did nothing. It says, \"I deserve to be a slave.\" But the other one did everything. Said, \"I deserve to be a son.\" That's the difference. How do you view yourself? And specifically, it has to do with the will. The will of one son said, \"I need to be a slave.\" The will of the other, \"I need to be a son.\" How do you view your walk with God right now? What is it that you believe that you deserve? Where is it you believe that you belong? How do you think that your walk with God should look like? Are you thinking that I'll do anything to be with God? Or are you thinking I'll only do what I need to do to be with God if he gives me something great in return? Don't expect anything from God. See, God will treat you as a son or daughter depending on your will cuz we know Matthew 7 says, \"Lord, you know, I've been slaving away from you just like this son. Lord, I've been driving out demons, performing many miracles. I've been prophesying in your name, preaching your word, and then Jesus says, I don't recall who you are. How you view yourself, how you view your servitude changes everything. Come on, bro. You know, the Bible talks about being transformed by the renewing of your actions. No, no, the renewing of your minds. How you view yourself is gravely important. [Music] You know in 2 Chronicles chapter 15 it says the Lord is with you when you are with him. Says if you seek him he will be found by you but if you abandon him he will abandon you. So we were born with God. We were born with this innocence. I know there are some people out there professing the Christian faith saying that you were born apart from God. That is not true. You are born innocent and with his love. But we abandon him. We chose to sin. And what it is, we have to realize we don't deserve anything. And we come to him full force. I'll do anything to be with you, God. Absolutely anything. And he only gives to you what he already had waiting for you. Come on. That's right. Your love and innocence. You know, so we can't over time become like the son who realize, you know, I deserve to be a son. You know, I think, you know, we've all lived that lifestyle where we've squandered our inheritance that God has given us. That's why we're here. Like, we no longer want to do that again. But over time, we don't want to view our decision to do anything for God then look at our hands and say, \"God, I'm a slave. I deserve better than this.\" Oh yeah. And we get bitter and we get angry. But we have to always give to God what we've decided in the first place. You know, the Bible says to remember our first love. Yeah. To always return to him. And so if you view yourself, you know, as a slave, God will treat you as a son. But if you believe that all you're doing is slave labor, then what you're doing is putting expectations on God. So, let's always have the right will and realize, you know, I will be willing to do anything for a guy. That's right. It's not about my reward. It's not about my expectation. I'm just tired of my old life. That's right. I'm just tired of what happens when I'm not surrendered. I'm tired of what happens the feelings that come to mind when I desire for control. I want nothing to do with this. I just need to be with God because he already has waiting for you the love that you're ready to give back to him. Let's go to Matthew chapter 25. Come on, bro. Bring it. On to our second point. In uh Matthew 25 and verse 24 uh the parable of the talents and we'll skip to the later portion as well. But you know the the master gives his servant a certain amount of talents and then goes away and comes back and he expects uh to be given back what he has given them. So he's given one servant 10 and he expects not just the 10 but then 20 in total. He gives one servant five and he expects 10 in total because he doubled the five that was given to him. But then there was one other servant, one that was given one. And I find that sometimes what happens is we're given one or we're given five, 10, 20, and we look at someone else, it's like, \"Wow, they have to give 40. They have to give double. If I only have one, how am I going to give 40?\" But God's not expecting you to give more than what he's already given you. Yeah. But we'll keep looking at this passage in verse 24. It says, \"The man who had received one talent also approached and said, \"Master, I know you. You are a harsh man, reaping where you haven't sown, gathering where you haven't scattered seed. So I was afraid and went off and hid your talents in the ground, see you have what is yours.\" His master replied to him, \"You evil, lazy servants. If you knew that I reap where I haven't sown and gather where I haven't scattered, then you should have deposited my money with the bankers and I would have received my money back with interest when I returned. So you know this servant, he took what God has given him and he hid it. He took what God has given him and he did nothing with it. Why? It literally says because he viewed the master as harsh. And in this parable revealing a greater tragedy for our spiritual lives today, what happens is we do nothing with what God has given us because we view God as harsh. And then even more so, it kind of describes how and why. Says you gather where you haven't scattered seed. You try to reap where you haven't sowed. Meaning he said go God or master I believe you demand too much from people around you. You expect seed. You expect the gather where they can't give you anything. There's nothing left to be given. I believe you're a harsh man. You expect too much from us. And I believe we can have that same mindset. I know I can share that. God wasn't mean to be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect. What does that mean? What does it mean to be blameless? Can I really deny myself? Can I really obey your word completely? And we have these thoughts. It's like, you know what? Maybe God demands too much from me. Come on, bro. I think God is a harsh man. And what happens is, as the servant did, he was afraid. And what happens when you're in fear and not the right kind of awe of fear of God, right? But fear of consequences rather than love for God, you get paralyzed. Hello. You do nothing. And so therefore, you hide what God has given you. I think there are many fears that as disciples that we can even face. Fear of failure. Come on. Fear that I can do anything and everything that God wants me to do, but will it really succeed? Come on, bro. Can I really be fruitful? Can I really deny myself? And that I've already failed before. There's no way I can actually do this. And we get paralyzed. We decide to completely forget denying oursel because of our fear of failure. It could be a fear of rejection. And the fear of rejection is not just, you know, fear of rejection from man sharing your faith, but fear of rejection from God. Will God really accept me? Come on, bro. Can I really? Am I really someone that he truly loves? Am I really here so he could love me? You know, I think about Anna and thinking about this question because we always ask ourselves, why are we here? Why did God create us? But going back to, you know, Anna, why is Anna here? I cannot answer that question really. Why is she here? I want to love her. That's why she's here. Come on. Anna's not here so she can serve me as a daughter. Anna's not on this planet so she can get a great job and make me look good. Anna is here because I love her. It's the same with God. And so when you have that fear of failure, fear of rejection, don't worry about that. You are here because God loves you. That's right. I find the the third fear, and there's many, but I find another common one is fear of uncertainty. And I find the way that plays out is doubt in God's promises that if I truly obey him, will he really give me salvation? Is salvation even possible? Can I really be free? Is what does it even look like to be free? And then what happens is you start to doubt instead of having faith. But looking at this passage, there's one thing blatantly clear. He was afraid and he was paralyzed. But that didn't matter to the master. You know, consequently, it it doesn't matter the reason why you're afraid because God says, the master says, \"You wicked, lazy servants, you still do nothing with what God has given you.\" So, it's a sad spectacle to for people to believe that, you know, God has put me on this earth and I can do nothing because there's nothing I could give to him. Well, you're partly right, but it's kind of a paradox because you're rejecting the love that he's given you. Wow. And he calls you wicked and lazy. So, even though, you know, we're not here for a spec any specific purpose other than to give that to God was already given to us, we can't choose to do nothing with what he's given us, right? You know, how you view God matters. And how do you view God today? Do you view God right now as someone who's demanding too much of you? Do you view God on the opposite spectrum that you can do absolutely anything and nothing matters in your life? That there's there's no point in even reading, there's no point in going to church, there's no point in discipling because none of that matters. Or do you view God like, you know, I see who he truly is and I see who he's made me to be. How wicked of me if I don't give him that love back. How do you view God? And I know for me, I've been there. I know what it's like to be paralyzed in your own fear. Paralyzed in, you know, my own insecurity. Paralyzed because, you know, I just want all these great things to happen here in the Tampa church. But you know what? I can't control anything. That's right. I have to give it all to God. That's right. But then I can't be mad at God saying, God, you demand too much of me. I say, you know what, God, I'm just so grateful to be in your presence. Amen. I'm so grateful to be with you. And it's not about what I'm capable of doing. It's not about my strength. I'm always going to have the will to serve you. That's what matters. Let's close out in Mark chapter 10. Come on, brother. Mark chapter 10. In verse 13, it says, \"People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, \"Let the little children come to me. Don't stop them because the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.\" After taking them in his arms, he laid his hands on them and blessed them. You know, the disciples, they viewed God in the wrong way here. They view Jesus in the wrong way. Jesus, you know, he he's too busy for your shenanigans. Don't bring your children to him. He's trying to teach us. But Jesus rebukes them. Says, \"What are you doing?\" Why? Because it is in his nature to receive those who are innocent. It is in his nature to receive those that have done nothing for him. And so he rebukes them because they have the totally wrong view of God. I am here for this very reason to bring in those who are innocent, blameless children who are ready to receive me. And he literally blesses children that have not given him anything. It it's symbolic for us. Come on. As children of God, it's awesome. ready to give us everything though we cannot possibly give him anything. That's what it means to be a children of God. So as a child of God, know this that there there is nothing that we could possibly give to God. But because of that, let us not take away from God the love that he's given to us in the first place. We are simply returning to the innocence and love that he has created us with. So let us be always be willing to do anything for him and let us never be afraid of him because like in this passage he is ready and able and willing to accept you as a child of God. To God be all the glory.",

    "transcript": "Please open your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 2. Isaiah chapter. I read this in my quiet time recently and uh I was thinking about how often we read this scripture. But then it never loses its power. monkey. It never loses its meaning. You can read the scripture over and over again for yourself, for other people, but it never loses its effectiveness. It all depends on our own hearts. Yeah. In Isaiah chapter 2, the Bible reads in verse one, \"The vision that Isaiah son of Amos saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the last days the mountain of the Lord's house will be established at the top of the mountains and will be raised above the hills. All nations will stream to it and many peoples will come and say, \"Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord.\" Amen. To the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us about his ways so that we may walk in his paths. For instruction will go out of Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. See, this passage is so incredible. But of course, there's so much context predating this passage. You know, starting from David, there was this reign of kings and Israel. They desperately wanted a king to be like the other nations around them. But after David came his son Solomon and Solomon brought about this golden era uh for all of Jerusalem and all of Judah. But as you read the book of Ecclesiastes, he was actually not a very uh spiritual king, right? Constantly giving into sin. And so it really showed by his son really following his example. And the kingdom split in two only two generations after King David. And from that moment on, after the kingdom split, you have this time of constantly going back into sin by God's people. People unable to lead them because of their lack of willingness. And this cycle of sin continues over and over and over again. And at one point, it reaches this time where God says, \"That's enough. I I am no longer going to tolerate this. I am sending another nation to conquer you.\" and they and this nation that is coming. He is speaking through this prophet Isaiah who we're reading in this book and he's telling of this time. He's saying God is going to send you the consequence of your sin. God is going to send you the one that will literally bring you into exile even if you have some semblance of remembering me. But there will be a consequence to your actions. And so we pick it up here is that Isaiah leaves a small good note in there. says, \"But at the end of all this, God will come down. He will come down on his mountain. And then when he comes down, even though we've struggled, we have these people, they've struggled to know God and know his word, there will be a time when they can learn from him directly. A time when they can literally walk and ascend this mountain and learn straight from God himself.\" So you hear in this passage a great crying out from the people who have finally left exile saying come let us go up to the mountain. You know I believe disciplehip is just that decision. You know you're you're leaving exile. Yeah. You're you're leaving the consequence of your own bad decisions. Amen. You're leaving the consequence of what happens when you live in a world that is full of wickedness, greed, impurity, pride, and selfishness. And now I was like finally can I just ascend this mountain so I can learn a new way of life directly from God. And you know it's really powerful because it's not only us saying come let us go but it's God himself calling us up the mountain. It is God himself saying will you ascend this mountain? My title for us today is simply will you ascend the mountain? Come on. And I want you guys all to know, you know, right now we're in missions. I'm sure we're probably thinking a lot about, you know, sins we're trying to overcome still. We're thinking about the life that we want to have with God in the future. But I want to reassure you right now that God is calling you up the mountain. Come on. Maybe you don't feel like the mountain is for you. Maybe you feel like the mountain is too treacherous. Maybe you feel like it's much easier to stay in the valleys. It's much easier to be maybe drowned in your sin. Maybe your sin is knee deep. Maybe your sin is uh uh shoulder deep. Maybe it's above your head. But God is calling you out of the deep, out of the valleys. He's calling you to ascend his mountain. And simply put, what is up the mountain? Well, first of all, it talks about that we may he will teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths. You see, on top of the mountain is God himself. But on the way up are his teachings. On the way up is his path. And that as you're gradually getting closer and closer to God, the air is getting thinner and thinner. And you're losing more and more energy. Guess what? You're also getting closer and closer to Jesus. Amen. Because you're learning from him directly, you know. And I believe that you know it's not uh people can operate in terms of you know those movies you know has the the the hero story per se and it's all about like they're fighting for this treasure and they they maybe they lose some people along the way but they make some friends along the way and they finally get to the treasure and it was never about the treasure. right? Never. Never was. It it was about the friends and the memories they made along the way. And the in those stories there's there's always a parallel. There's always the villain. The villain is typically the one who prioritizes the treasure, prioritizes the end, and is willing to drop everything behind in those films, in those TV shows. And I believe, you know, for us, uh, you know, we have to ascend that mountain with his teachings. Amen. Walking in his ways. Some people, they want to stay in the valleys and they want the mountain top to come to them. But, you know, if you continue on in Isaiah, if you're staying in the valleys and a mountain flips upside down, you know what's going to do? It's going to crush you. You do not want the mountain to come to you. You want to go up to the mountain top. Amen. Amen. And though you know what what you're risking is your livelihood. You're you're risking the chance of you know what is there really a future for me if I leave my comfortability? But God is promising you that there is. But you have to leave your valleys. Let's go to Jeremiah chapter 50. All right. Okay. Jeremiah chapter 50. Right. A very similar passage to this. Right. It says in verse four, come on. In those days, very similar like it said in the last days, in those days and at that time, this is the Lord's declaration, the Israelites and Judeans will come together weeping as they come, and they will seek the Lord their God. They will ask about Zion, turning their faces to this road. They will come and join themselves to the Lord in a permanent covenant that will never be forgotten. Amen. See, very similarly though, the last passage that we read, Isaiah was the prophet telling all of God's people what was about to happen. But at this point, Jeremiah is telling God's people after the exile happens now where they're going to go from there. And it's the same exact message. You know, the part that sticks to me the most is when it says that they're weeping as they go. Amen. You know, they they experience the consequences of their sin and they were in exile and finally the remnant, those who survived are now walking toward the mountain top. But sadly, they they had a few friends that they lost along the way. They had a few brothers and sisters that didn't make it through the exile that that didn't make it through the consequences of their sin. But yet here you see they're still pressing forward. They're still going on ahead. I find one of the biggest struggles, you know, um as a disciple is looking back. And sometimes it's not always looking back towards sin. It's just looking back at all the friends and the family who have decided not to chase God. And then you question yourself, is it really worth this? Did I really make the right decision? And you know what? I love this passage says weeping as they go. It's okay to feel something. And it's okay to feel hurt by it. But the main thing you get from this is that you still go up the mountain. Amen. You still ascend on your way towards God. And very similar to the last passage where it talks about his teaching on the way towards the mountain, this one is saying a covenant will be established as we walk up that mountain. And you know, this covenant is uh super important because it's not just God saying, \"Hey, I'm going to teach you, but say, I'm going to promise to always be with you as long as you're always with me.\" You know, um I' I've been thinking a lot about this lately, this concept of of weeping, this concept of really learning from God. And you know, uh going up the mountain, it is painful. Being a disciple, it it doesn't come without its hurt. It doesn't come without its struggle. And I think the most important thing is always pressing forward. That's what matters. Always pressing forward. You know what we learned in looking at these two passages is that it's it's loyalty over the feeling of love. And that, you know, you will feel the infatuation. You will feel the joy. You will feel the times when you're you're ecstatic at all these different emotions, but when those die down, will you still be loyal? See, that's the point of a covenant. It said that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Yeah, imagine if Christ waited for you not to be a sinner anymore. We'd all be stuck in our sins. We would all be stuck. But God made that decision proving that we can be loyal to him no matter what's happening in our lives. Amen. If he can do it, if he can choose to establish a covenant while we're still stuck in sin, then we can choose to be loyal. Even if we're wavering in our feelings, even if we're wavering, we can still choose to press forward, weeping as we go. Let's go to Luke chapter 4. Come on. Luke chapter 4. You know, I think um what's amazing about God calling us up the mountain, I think of the the parable of the prodigal son. Yeah. And it's like God is waiting for you to leave those valleys. He's waiting for you to leave those depths. And it's not like he's waiting for you to come back and say, \"I told you so.\" But but he has wide open arms cuz he he knew that you would come to this kind of decision. I believe the reason why we're all here right now is because we at least have an open ear at the very least to even realize that God is calling us to go up this mountain. And what it is is choosing to be with him and forgetting everything else that we want to bring along with us. You know, I think in in those kinds of things, what do the things that we want to bring in our relationship with God are the things often times that he doesn't want us to bring. We want to bring our own sense of self-justice. We want to bring our our own sense of what makes us feel good. We want to bring our own plans and our own future. But God has something better waiting for you. Amen. And just like the prodical son, he had to go through terrible times to realize that he's like, you know what? If only I was a slave in my father's households. That's what it means to ascend the mountain. You've come to the decision that it is far better to serve God than your own vices. In Luke chapter 4, we'll close out here, right? We're going to see the fulfillment of God coming down here to earth and establishing his mountain, his kingdom. It says Luke 4:16, \"He came to Nazareth where he had been brought up as usual. He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood to read. The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. And unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written, \"The spirit of the Lord is on me. Because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.\" Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him. He began by saying to them, \"Today, as you listen, the scripture has been fulfilled.\" See, the the people, they were waiting a long time for God to come down and teach them. And in that time they sadly you know had leaders that went into led led with hypocrisy. They had people who even willingly followed that. And then now Jesus has come down and saying guess what I am now here to teach you. I am now here to guide you up. And for all those who are still captive, who are still laying low, not knowing how to ascend the mountain, not knowing what it means to be close to God, not knowing what it means to push through struggles, hardships, and temptation, he has come down himself personally saying, \"I have come to guide you. I have come to heal you. I have come to, you know, uh, take the give you back your sights, to take off the the the the shackles of being imprisonment to your sin. I have come for that very reason. And, you know, today, even as we sit here right now, you know, we're looking at this beautiful, gorgeous view. You know, we're taking in the heat. Some people have fans right now. I I hope that we can never forget why we're here in the first place. You know, we're here to ascend that mountain. We're here to learn from Jesus. Amen. And we're here to keep the covenant that he has made with us. And so if you're deciding right now, you know, am I going to follow his ways? Or you've already decided, keep on pressing forward. And if you're deciding right now, do I want to make a covenant? What is a covenant with God? What does it mean to get baptized? What does it mean to repent? And maybe you have made those decisions, keep on pressing forward because up that mountain, you will finally be with God. And you know, right now, I think in with everything going on um with missions, with you know, the hopes and the futures for where we want to be, our disciplehips, the main thing that's the most important is that we press forward. And to God be all the glory.",

    "transcript": "Happy Mother's Day, everybody. It was so cool seeing the kids come out with the roses. That was awesome. Uh cuz uh you know, mothers, I'm so grateful for them. Of course, I wouldn't be here without my mother, but I'm also grateful to the mother of my child, Natalie. Amen. And you can't have a Mother's Day Sunday without a Mother's Day lesson. So, let's turn our Bibles to Genesis chapter 1. Genesis chapter 1. Uh, before getting into the real meat of the lesson today, uh, I want to talk about the nature or I would say natures of God. And in Genesis chapter 1, we learned something really cool since the beginning. And it says in verse 26, \"Then God said, let us make man in our image according to our likeness. They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, the whole earth, and all and the creatures that crawl on the earth.\" So God made man in his own image. He created him in the image of God. He created them male and female. So God created mankind, men and woman. Amen. And when he created both of them, they are both in the image of one God. So even though we have one God, we have two very distinct types of people, men and women. But it's really cool that you learn that later on in Genesis that when two men and women become one in marriage, they become one. And I believe this symbolizes two very distinct natures becoming one, which is one nature of God. And so you have distinct qualities, personality traits, and characteristics that God has put inside of all men. But then also into woman that are very different. And when the two become one, it's like the image of God becomes clear. Two very different natures coming together. Let's go to Deuteronomy 33. Continuing in this nature or natures of God. In Deuteronomy 33 in verse 29, it says, \"How happy you are, Israel.\" Uh so what happens is Moses at this time you know they're entering the promised lands but Moses because of his own sin doesn't get to enter but he seems with joy over the children of Israel. And this is the last thing he has to say in this song. How happy you are Israel. Who is like you a people saved by the Lord. He is the shield that protects you. The sword you boast in. Your enemies will cringe before you and you will tread on their backs. See, when I first read this passage, it sounds incredible. It sounds like, you know, Moses trying to instill strength into his people going into the promised land without him. But there's one really cool thing that he tells the people of Israel about God. Says, \"Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is like the shield that protects you, the sword that you boast in.\" You see, to win a war, you can't just have a sword. My coach always told me playing basketball that a good offense is an even better defense and that even defense wins games. So as good as you are offensively with a sword, you still need a shield. I believe this also symbolizes God's dual nature. A shield that protects and a sword that fights. And I find this that men, we are the sword that fights. Amen. And God has given us the ability to to have the the the dominant strength so we can fight for our loved ones. But I believe in the same way God has created in woman the ability to protect, the ability to be a shield. And I believe we see this in nature and that there is nothing more protective than a mother caring for her children. And I want to talk about this today. Our title is God our shield. We're going to be talking about the the more uh the nature of God that he has instilled in women that he has instilled in mothers. The nature to protect and even in this passage it literally says uh he is a shield that protects you. That word protect is the same word that is used when God tells Adam I will make a suitable helper for you. It's the same exact word. So God is describing himself as one who protects the same way he tells Adam, \"I'm going to give you a woman that will help you.\" It's the same nature of God. And so let's go to Secron chapter 20. We're going to be talking about this nature that protects, this nature that shields you. And point number one, what I believe all mothers do a great job at is they teach us not to be afraid to fail. Point number one, don't be afraid to fail. And you know, God, he's not going to keep you from failing. Amen. He's not going to keep you from experiencing defeat because why? Failure keeps you humble. And when done correctly, failure will teach you that reliance on God is not optional. In 2 Chronicles 20, the Bible says in verse one, \"After this, the Moabites and Ammonites together with some of the Mammonites came to fight against Jehoshaphat.\" So in this situation, you know, the king of Judah of God's people all of a sudden is faced with a vast army. And this is how he reacts. People came and told Jehoshaphat, \"A vast number from beyond the Dead Sea and from Edom has come to fight against you. They were already in Haison Tamar that is Engeti. Jehoshaphat was afraid and he resolved to seek the Lord. Then he proclaimed a fast for all Judah who gathered to seek the Lord. They even came from all the cities of Judah to seek him. So the situation was this that this vast army came to Jehoshaphat came to God's people and what does Jehoshaphat do? He says, \"I am going to resolve myself to seek the Lord.\" You see, what happens is, you know, even for us today, we can be afraid of failure, afraid of tasting defeat. But what it's supposed to do is bring us to our knees. Bring us to realize that God is our shield. And so, Jehoshaphat realizes this, that there's nowhere he could go except to God. And not only does he realize this, but he calls all of his people, all of Judah, all of God's people to do the exact same. that if I'm going to do this, we're not going to do I'm not going to do this alone. I'm going to call all of us to do this together. And in verse 10, let let's see what he prays to God. It says, \"Now here are the Ammonites, Moabites, and the inhabitants of Mount Seir. You did not let Israel invade them when Israel came out of the land of Egypt, but Israel turned away from them and did not destroy them. Look how they repay us by coming to drive us out of our possession that you gave us an inheritance.\" Our God, will you not judge them? For we are powerless before this vast number that comes to fight against us. We do not know what to do, but we look to you. All Judah was standing before the Lord with their dependent, their wives, and their children. And I can imagine this situation. I could relate to this. Those times when you're looking at God, you're like, \"God, what is happening to me? What is going on? I don't even understand this because this army that was fighting against Jehoshaphat, they were the the people that they actually spared. So he's like, God, I literally spared these people and now they're coming to take over us. What is happening? And I can imagine the despair that Jehoshaphat felt. And so he's standing there with all the other Israelites says, \"God, we don't know what to do, but our eyes are on you.\" And it wasn't just Jehoshaphat or the fighting men, but it was their wives and their children as well. And it goes on to have some of the most incredible passages in the Bible. In verse 15, it says, \"Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast number, for the battle is not yours, but God's.\" So he he God is bringing them to a point to where they have to rely on him. And in verse 17, it says, \"You do not have to fight this battle. Position yourselves. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.\" So it's it's so incredible seeing what happens is God says, \"You know what? Position yourselves. Stand ready. Be ready to fight. However, I am going to do the fighting for you. But you have to get ready. You have to stand tall.\" You know, I know for me, um, well, one story that, uh, has really shaped me in my life because of my mother was, uh, have has anyone here seen the movie Coach Carter? Coach Carter. Yeah. Um, there's some scenes you have to skip. Amen. But I remember, uh, my parents were actually the ones that showed me that movie and they wanted to instill this certain character in me because when I was in the sixth grade, uh, my my basketball coach, he I think he just wanted to be the next Coach Carter. He just wanted to be the coach that drove you super hard. If you haven't seen the movie, what happens is he trains uh all the teammates, all the basketball players to run and run and run and learn to have great endurance. And often weeks and days and practices at a time, they never pick up a basketball. So I'm in middle school. I'm 13 years old, 12 years old. And my coach and I just want a basketball. You know, you're a young little kid. and my coach, we'd get on the court and we used to do drill after drill after drill, running in circles, running in laps, going on the field, coming back inside and running, and then practice is over. We never touch the basketball. And I was just getting more and more fed up practice after practice. I just want to play, you know, you're a young little kid. I'm not trying to build my endurance. Want to have fun. And I remember one Saturday we would have practices, too, 12 years old. and we went uh to this park that had a basketball court. And so I was like, \"Okay, this is good.\" Like we're going to play some pickup. It's going to be fun. And we go and we're doing like bear crawls on the dirt. We're doing these things called duck walks where like your kn your knees are like touching each other and you're squatting down and you're going like you're going like that. And we're practicing and we're we're doing all these drills for two hours straight. And then finally we get it in, we say a huddle and you know we say it was a good practice and we're done. And I'm like there's a basketball court right there, coach. Like if you have a basketball in your trunk, let's just play. But we went we went the whole practice out picking up basketball. And I remember I got home and I told my mom, I'm like, I'm done. Like I am not playing under this guy. I'm not playing basketball anymore. Let's just find a different sport. And I remember in that moment like I would I would imagine that my mom would be like, \"Okay, we'll find the right sport for you.\" This is what she told me. She said, \"I didn't raise a quitter.\" And I had that. And I remember I was I was crying. I was like I was like, \"What? Like where did that come from, Mom? I I could just do a different sport, you know? I just want a different coach.\" But I was like, \"No, because it's hard for you, you're going to keep going.\" And that instilled in me something that day to even when something is hard, I have to continue to push myself because I later on in life, I grew a great appreciation for basketball. And I love the game. But I wouldn't have ever gotten to that point if my mother never pushed me. And I believe that's what it means for God to be our shield. You know, God is not there to cuddle you. He is not there to reassure you when times are hard. He's there to inspire you. He's there to encourage you. And even when you want to throw in the towel, what it is that you're doing is you're quitting on yourself. But God is saying, \"I still have strength reserved for you. You can keep going.\" And I love this because what it is that we learn that him being our shield that he will always protect us because our flesh is weak. You know, it's it's if we get hit with an arrow, hit with a sword, we're done for. But because we have our shield, we don't look to our strength or our ability. We look to God's ability. Amen. And so that's why we cannot ever be afraid to fail. Um let's keep going here. Let's go to Luke chapter 12. And I believe God's first calling for us to not be afraid of failure is not only not be afraid of failure, to not be afraid of defeats, but we learn from this passage to resolve ourselves. to resolve oursel to seek the Lord and then if you stand tall and if you give your all, God will carry you through. Amen. I love the quote. It says, \"If you give your best, God will do the rest.\" And in uh Luke chapter 12, point number two, is God your security? Is God your security? In Luke chapter 12 in verse 13 the Bible reads some from someone from the crowd said to him teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me friends he said to him who appointed me a judge or arbitrator over you same thing it's like God he I just want what I want you see my my my brother is not splitting the inheritance and Jesus God in the flesh says that's not my business bro like why why am you why are you pointing me judge over you? And let's keep reading. Let's see what he says. Says he then told them, \"Watch out and be on guard against all greed because one's life is not in the abundance of his possessions.\" Then he told them a parable. A rich man's land was very productive. He thought to himself, \"What should I do since I don't have anywhere to store my crops? I will do this,\" he said. I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones and store all my grain and my goods there. Then I'll say to myself, \"You have many goods stored up for many years. Take it easy. Eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.\" But God said to him, \"You fool, this very night your life is demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?\" That's how it is with those with the one who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God. Point number two is God your security. You see this man, he was storing up crops and he was a farmer and it says that his land was so productive that he wanted to tear down his barns and build bigger ones. And literally he was willing to alter his farming priorities. And even here what he says, he literally says, um, I have nowhere to store my crops. But we just learned that he already had barns. So what is the real issue here is that he saw that his barns weren't enough to the point where he literally said, \"I don't even have any.\" He wasn't content with what God gave him. To the point where he would destroy his current barns and build larger ones. And you know that's the beginning of what happens when you start to treasure things other than God. You literally tear down what God has given you and reprioritize your life to build bigger barns. And to the point where you know he does it say I'm going to take it easy. And God says you fool your life will be demanded of you. Which is quite incredible because he never even did it yet. It was still a thought. He never tore down the barns. He was thinking of what he would do. He had these big plans for his life. And what is God saying? Why are you even planning your life ends tonight? See, it's so important to put your security in God because there are so many things that people are willing to focus on. They take what God has given them, but you know, I'm going to solo in on one thing. I'm going to solo in on my family. You know, many people they reject trying to live like a disciple because their lives are so busy maybe taking care and supporting their family that might be across the seas right now. You know, many people they don't want to put the effort in to become a disciple maybe because they're focusing on their education, focusing on their careers, focusing on their children, on their parents. Maybe it be wealth, knowledge, wisdom, all these other things which once again God wants you to have. The man already had barns. But what happened was that he chose to rep prioritize his life and tear down the barns for his own purpose. See, him being a farmer, he would have had multiple other sources of income, not just crops. But because his crops were productive, he tore down what he could have used and, you know, had other avenues of revenue. You know, he could have had barns for cattle, barns for sheep, barns for uh other kinds of crop, whatever it may be. But I'm going to solo in on what I find to be productive. And sadly, it says that his life was taken from him tonight. I find that for us, even when we choose to prioritize other things, we tear down things in our life to build bigger and better barns. But when we build those larger things, when we rep prioritize our life towards things that God doesn't want to prioritize, those big barns just become big altars. Altars to the idols that we worship. And you know, some people have the privilege of God burning down those barns, burning down those altars and those idols and to the point to where they realize this and they come back to him. But some people don't have that privilege. God lets them build those barns and instead of losing those barns, they lose their soul in the process and their life is demanded them from them and they totally lost track of what they should have been doing all along. And that's why we cannot let the big barns that we build from tearing down what we could have had with God become our idols. We have to put our security in God. you know, um I remember when I uh fell away at 14, uh I when I was telling my parents about it, my one thing that my mom and I always had a connection on was whenever she would cry, I would cry, too. And so if we're sitting there watching a movie, I'm like, \"This movie is corny.\" And I look over my mom and she's crying, I'm like, \"What the heck is like now I'm now I'm crying. I'm feeling I'm feeling worked up.\" You know, I remember one time I was showing her an episode that I thought was so sad at that point already watched, already cried and I showed her it and then now she's like and I I just finished watching this and I wanted to show her and now I'm crying again. I'm like, I just got this all out of me. Why am I crying again? And but I remember when when I fell away and she was crying. I remember that moment because it was like a light switch that I turned off and I no longer cried when she cried. I find that's what happens when you lose your security in God. God wants you to prioritize certain things, certain avenues of your life, but because you want to go a whole different direction, you become numb and you turn the light switch off. You're like, \"God, I'm going to burn down these bars. I'm going to build my own and they're going to be bigger and better than the barns that you gave me. And you know, we have to be careful not to build those idols in our life. You know, God wants us to have the barns that he gives us, but he doesn't want you to tear down the ones he gave you so you can focus on what you want to focus on. We have to do what he wants. And I love it because right after this passage, the answer is right there. Immediately after in verse 22 it says then he said to his disciples therefore I tell you don't worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear for life is more than food and the body more than clothing and there is no coincidences in the Bible. Amen. So right after it talks about not building these idols and these altars in your life after burning down what God has given you saying instead I need you to not worry about anything even if it's productive focus on me and if you keep reading it talks about seeking first his kingdom in verse 31 and then verse 34 it says where your treasure is there your heart is also so the issue with was with this man is that he decided to build treasures in his productivity ity. But God said, \"No, your treasure should be in me. You should be content with what you have.\" See, when you worry, your security is not in God. And when your security is not in God, you begin to worry. It's a cycle. It repeats itself. And the only way to get out of this cycle is literally just how I shouldn't have done. I have to turn back on the light switch. It's literally a decision. The decision to not worry and seek first his kingdom. Just like we read Jehoshaphat when he said, \"I'm going to resolve myself to seek the Lord.\" Amen. Um, and what you worry about when what you're anxious about will become your master. There's this quote that I find very powerful. It says, \"Any person capable of angering you becomes your master.\" He can only anger you when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him. It's an allowance. But you know, you read that quote and it doesn't exactly match with the Bible. I believe that uh according to what the scripture says, it should actually say anyone capable of worrying you becomes your master. You are worried by him because you permit yourself uh to be done to. And so it's super careful and where we have to walk and how we have to walk because you have to decide not to be held uh accountable by your own emotions. See what happens in these moments you know anger whether it be worrying whether it be anxiety whether it be stress the moment you give into those emotions and you restructure your life because of those emotions then those emotions have become your master. And just like this passage where right before it talks about the man that is building his new barns, do you know what comes right before the Matthew account of not to worry? Let's go to this. Go to Matthew chapter 6. Let's see. Let's see what it says. Once again, there's no coincidences. Right before Matthew 6 and verse 25, it says in verse 24, \"No one can serve two masters.\" There is no coincidences in the Bible. Amen. What happens when you begin to worry and you restructure your life because of that worry? Your master is no longer God. Your security is no longer in God. Now it has become your worrying. Your master has now become your emotions. But the Bible says to put your treasures in God. Put your security in God. And we have to make that to be a decision. Let's not wait for the emotions to be right, the emotions to be high. We come to church service, we're singing great songs. Let it be every single day of your life to decide to give all your emotions, all your worry, all your anxiety to God. Amen. And you know, the way you do this is just as the Bible says, you have to do what is right according to the Bible. It is a decision. It is a decision to put God first. And I believe that when you do this, you put your security in God, he will truly be your shield. He will truly be one that protects you because you're not relying on your flesh to take the hits. You allow God to take those hits because you go and obey his word. And when God is your shield and you're not even afraid to fail because of how much he's protecting you and you put your security in him, then we can truly understand the nature of God that he even put in our mothers. You know, I love that if we can truly make God our shield, I find that we appreciate our family all the more. You know, even as I read this passage, I think about how much I appreciate my mom for the lessons that she taught me. And then I find even here in this room, maybe, you know, you're sometimes for Mother's Day, it might be a sad moments for people who had mothers that may not have treated them that well. But I love being in a in the kingdom of God because we have spiritual mothers that can fill that role. And the only reason why is because we have God's word. God's word that we can hold ourselves accountable to. And then even, you know, for us today going from this room, we have missions coming up. You know, we we're trying to evangelize all of Tampa, but we can only do it if we rely on God. If we allow him to be our help. So, let's make God our shield. Let's put our security in God. And let's not be afraid to fail. To God be all.",

    "transcript": "You know, when I first started the Bible, I was 13 years old, and my my biggest issues as a 13-year-old uh were simply just cursing, pride, and lust. That was the the extent of my problems as a 13-year-old said the Bible. And after about a year of constantly being tempted and now facing a a world that I'm just now really getting to experience, you know, I went to a a private high school for basketball and now all of a sudden I was surrounded by these people who had great wealth. And so now I'm tempted with like, oh, I want to seek after wealth. I want to seek after being known, being well liked, you know, and all these different things. And after about a year of that, I remember my my disciple at the time, Michael Schaefer. And if you guys know Michael Schaefer, he's a he's a character. And uh uh and Michael Schaefer, you know, we would spend time skating together. Uh he would take it after work. Uh he worked actually as a um a special needs teacher. And so after work, he would uh come over, we'd go skating together, we play games together, we watch movies together, spend time together, all these different things. And I remember after about a year though of really being tested and tempted with life, I I called him and I said, \"I I want nothing to do with this. I want I want nothing to do with discipling. I want nothing to do with the church. I I want to just give into the way I I want to live.\" And I thought at the moment that by giving up, I was making my life easier. And so what I ended up doing was I was I isolated myself. And I remember the feeling for the first year was the overwhelming fear of death. And the only way to to overcome that it would be to go to God. But instead, I decided to be apathetic. I I decided to have self-hatred instead. And once I hit college, I remember now all of these temptations and issues and problems in life there is now piling up on me. And you know, I started uh developing a drinking habit where I was drinking nearly daily, even outside of the parties that were happening, I would use my fake ID to go and get drinks and drink whenever I could because whenever I had the chance to drink, it felt like I was able to beat someone that I wasn't. I was able to be strong. I was able to be confident. And these were things that I I did not feel even the slightest semblance when I wasn't drinking. And you know that that same part of me that I was trying to run away from was actually every single day just devouring it. I was trying to run away from who I was and fight perseverance and fight endurance and thought that if I could run away from that I could truly be myself. But in the end I end up being devoured by that same thought that I am the least like myself that I could be. And it takes drinking for that to come out. And so I remember when I started studying the Bible again uh at around 19, I had to decide. I had to decide if I was going to continue in my life of sin in my wicked ways and trying to reason with it or will I actually stand up and stop allowing myself to be devoured by my sinful nature. And so on August 18th, 2020, I was baptized. Amen. And you know, you would you would only hope that it got easier from there. You know, you would only hope. And and from that point on, I remember I can reflect on it. You know, um the the first six months of my disciplehip, it was in New York in New York City during COVID, everything's on lockdown. I remember having to share my faith on WebEx. If you guys ever used WebEx, it's like Zoom. And you know, you're looking at your classmates kicked. This is really awkward, you know. I just had me on that message and then, you know, I was able to go to Philadelphia for a little bit. Um, all the brothers on that mission team, the campus brothers fell away. So, I went to go support them for the summer. Um, and then I come back and now I'm a full-time intern. And in all this time, I'm still like learning like how to share my faith still. I'm still trying to figure it out. And yet, they asked me to be on staff and I'm still learning. I'm still growing. I'm trying to figure things out. Uh I'm being tested in my patience still. I'm being tested in my endurance. And I remember um shortly after that, you know, Nat and I start dating once I come back. And then we get married. And from the time we're dating to getting married was six months. And I proposed after three months. And at the six months mark, um he's got to got to go quick, brother. He's got to go quick. Um and after the sixth month we got married. Two weeks later we ship shipped to India. So now we're in India. We're living our now new disciplehip in India. And it's it's really tough because the Bible talks about when you're at war and you become a soldier that you should spend the first year at home. I spent the first year in India. And that was rough because that set the the the stone the foundation for our marriage. So coming back from India was a lot of reworking. A lot of reworking hurts how we communicate with each other because now what we're dealing with the stress and the the work of being in a foreign nation trying to you know save people. Now we come home we're trying to figure it all out. And so I know that for me, I've tripped time and time again in my disciplehip, in my impatience, in my pride, in my anger, in my impurity, in my laziness, in my selfish ambition, in my hatred. I remember as a year being a disciple, I found out that my my mother almost avoided me when I was younger because of how my biological dad treated her. And so I remember first learning that after being a disciple for a year. So I had to ask myself again, am I going to forgive this man? It was already hard to forgive him in the beginning, but now I'm a disciple. Learned that I was almost aborted and now it's even harder to forgive him. I remember I stayed up for hours praying. I was not willing to go to sleep unless I was able to forgive him. And all these times I've tripped in my disciplehip, you know, I've I've had to contemplate like, am I going to go back to that life of sin that I I ran to when I was 15 and walked away? And even though I've tripped, I've had to ask myself, am I going to keep getting up? And so maybe right now for you, maybe right now you're still being devoured. Maybe you're still being devoured by your sinful nature. Maybe it be your weaknesses or what you tell yourself that you're strong in what you're capable of doing when what you think you're strong in, you're actually being devoured by that very weakness that you pretend is not there. Or maybe that you you decide to run. You decide to not be devoured, but you're constantly tripping and you're constantly being tested because you're not learning what God is trying to teach you. Well, I have a scripture for you. Go to second Peter chapter 3. My my title for us is without spot or blemish. Second Peter chapter 3. And the Bible says in verse 14, \"Therefore, dear friends, while you wait for these things, make every effort to be found without spot or blemish in his sights at peace.\" Also regard the patience of our Lord as salvation. Just as our dear brother Paul has written to you according to wisdom given to him. He speaks about these things in all his letters. There are some things hard to understand in them. The untaught uh and unstable will twist them to their own destruction as they also do with the rest of the scriptures. Therefore, dear friends, since you know this in advance, be on your guard so you are not led away by error lawless people and fall from your own stable position, but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen. You know this was written by Peter and out of any of the apostles who decided to come back including Jesus. Amen. Judas. Amen. But he has fallen many many times. Peter has tripped many many times. There's one time literally Peter told Jesus not to go to the cross. That is probably the last thing to ever tell Jesus not to do. Don't go to the cross. And Jesus in response literally says, \"Get behind me, Satan.\" That's his response. That's that's how terrible the decision that Peter made. U and of course later uh Peter falls asleep while Jesus is praying, pouring out his heart to God when he was selected amongst the disciples to come and accompany him while he is in deep anguish and he decides to fall asleep. And then of course he he denies him three times to the point where he really calls upon uh curses rejecting that he ever met Jesus. And after Jesus died, he goes back to his old life. You find him again fishing and showing that when Jesus the day that he was going to resurrect, Peter lost all hope and he's found back in his old lifestyle. And the last significant blunder that Peter had was that he actually was uh showing prejudice and racism towards the gentile converts into Christianity to the point to where he didn't even fellowship with them. Imagine, you know, there's a brother or sister in the church. They're hang out. I don't like what that was their answer and that was like their conviction. I'm a disciple but like I don't want to be a part of your life. That was literally Peter. He allowed himself to be persuaded by other Jews, uh, Jewish converts in the community to not fellowship with Gentile converts. And after all of that, he writes this letter. And out of the two letters, his last one, and is the last thing he writes in his last letter, and he says to make every effort coming from a man who knows how to fall, but then knows how to get back up. And the last thing he said is make every effort. keep on fighting. Point number one, make every effort. You know, um I like to think of of Christianity in different ways that help me teach people. Everybody's a different kind of learner. There's people who learn through hearing, through visualization, and they do it by their own practice, right? For me, I'm a good visual learner, right? Uh this is what helped me a little bit. What are your guys' favorite animals? Just name a few. blue whale, snow leopard, lion, wolf, some some ferocious animals, right? One of my favorite animals, also a ferocious animal, and it's a bear. Something about giant grizzly bears, they're they're just fascinating, you know? Like they can climb trees and they're huge, but like if you try to climb a tree, like you can't run from it, you know? They're they're extremely fast. Their feet are huge. They're super fast. So, you can't outrun it. You can't climb a tree to avoid it. And it's not like alligator where after 30 feet it gets worn out, it'll keep chasing it. So they're but at the same time it all depends on whether they're hungry. So if they're not hungry, they won't even attempt it. And so they're unpredictable, they're crazy, and they do not get tired. I think bears are kind of interesting. I I like to think of Christianity as running from a pack of bears. Run from follow, right? Run from pack. Follow me. Uh, some of you guys are like, \"What does he want to say right now?\" Running from a pack of bears. But, okay. So, if you're running from a pack of bears, you're thinking to yourself, \"Okay, you have one, two options. I'm going to keep running. I don't know where there is safety. I don't know how long I'll be running. I don't know if I have the strength left to keep on running until I find shelter, but I am going to continue to run until somehow I get out of the line of sight of this bear.\" And that's how some people approach their Christianity. I'm just going to do whatever it takes to keep on going. There's no point in looking back. There's no point in questioning, just catching up. I'm just going to keep going forward. Or there are some people when they're running from a pack of bears, they tell themselves, you know what? There's no point in running. The the bear will eventually catch up. I'm just going to get exhausted. I'm going to get tired. I might as well accept my fate now and just be devoured and mauled by this bear, you know. And then I find there is a third kind of person. There is the person that does decide to run, but they trip and they trip and the bear gets closer and closer and closer and to the point to where now the bear is at an arms length when they could have relied on God's strength to keep moving forward because the bear you can't outrun it. But that's what's really cool about visualizing it with bra with a pack of bears because you need God's strength. You can't do it on your own. And you know, I like to think of it this way. You know, I love to share my faith. I love making disciples. And I would say over the past few years now more than ever, but it's because I know what it's like to be devoured. I know what it's like to allow myself and literally choose to stop running and be devoured by that bear, be devoured by my sinful nature. And you know, in in becoming a disciple, I've tripped more times than than I would like to admit, and I've allowed that bear to even get a few swings in in my own life. But I do not want to stop running. I have no desire to stop running, especially now knowing what it's like to allow myself to be torn limb from limb from my own sinful nature. And so when I open my mouth and I share my faith and I open the Bible, I think to myself, how can I help this person also come out of that being deval? I I wonder if they even realize this. I wonder if they realize what their actions lead to. I wonder if they realize that there is a way out of their torments. I wonder how often they think to themselves, can I find a way out? But they see no example around them and so they believe that it is useless. I wonder how often they look down on people. How often they hate? How often they give into their act they regret? How often do they objectify people? How often they look down on others? And I think to myself, how can I help them come out of this? Because I know what that is like. You know, Luna came up here a a little bit ago for heroes of faith. He's been a disciple for one year and and his when he became a disciple, he went to Warner and it's a Christian college and he shared the Bible with all of his soccer teammates, all of them. And only one of them got baptized. And that one person that got baptized also fell away. And so you know what Luna says after all of that? I want to be I said I want to be a Bible popular reader. I love Luna because when he comes to camp, he talks about how much he smiles. You would not guess that his family persecutes him and that his school would persecute him, that all his friends that he would study with did not want to associate with what he believed in. comes to campus with a smile on his face afterward and yeah amen clap hopefully he can hear it but it's it's really incredible what he's done because in the face of discouragement he decides to keep on standing and to keep on running I believe is actually a very great example of making every effort just go to Jeremiah chapter 12 and in Jeremiah One of my favorite scriptures, it says in verse one, \"You will be righteous, Lord.\" Amen. Even if I bring a case against you, yet I wish to contend with you. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the treacherous live at ease? See, Jeremiah, you know, was a prophet sent by God to the people of Judah. as he's looking around and said, \"God, like you sent me to help these people, but yet some of them are living better lives than I am. How am I your messenger looking at their lives and why do I feel envy? Why do why do they get to live at ease?\" And you know, I find this to be a very common question for us today. You know, when we made the decision to obey God, to follow God, to make every single effort, but sometimes we look outside of our own effort, we get distracted by what's around us, and we ask ourselves, what's the point? What's the point in continuing to run if I'm just going to get devoured anyways? And I love God God's response in verse five. Says, \"If you have raced with runners and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in a peaceful lands, what will you do in the thicket of the Jordan? So what did God say in his trivial question? God says, why are you getting worn out when you're still on the training grounds? Like I am still trying to work up your faith to the point to where you can do incredibly more things, but you're being worn out by trading. And then he says, well, why do you stumble in country? He's talking about why do you stumble over every challenge that comes your way when God is still molding you to take on larger and greater challenges. You see, I I think sometimes we get a little fixated. We get fixated on our temptations, on our struggles, and instead of making it about our effort, we now look outward. But it's really amazing about God saying, \"You're to blame because it means that it's in your control to fix. it's in your control to to change that. Um, and so making every effort, I love it because in the Greek the word is fazo and it means to exert oneself. So I want to ask you, do you exert yourself in your disciplehip? Do you make every effort in your disciplehip? Especially when you least want to especially when it is most difficult, you know, because we wouldn't do it with our jobs. Imagine if every single time you didn't want to go to work, you did this. How long would you have a job for? Imagine every single time you were tired and worn out and you cut, you come back home and you have a wife and kids and you say, \"You know what? Not today. Maybe next time.\" But you're always going to be tired after work. So imagine you keep coming back over and over again and you say, \"You know what? No more. I'm tired. I can't do And then time and time again, how would your family feel? How would your kids feel? And of course, how would your boss feel? So, if we wouldn't do that in any other area of our life, why would we do it to God? Wh why would we literally see ourselves when we're worn out and say, you know what, maybe it's time to stop. Maybe it's time to draw back. But when it comes to our family, our friends, our work, we would never do that. So, we have to give God all the more honor and glory. Amen. You know, I found this quote and uh it made me really think a lot about it for myself. Even this quote said, \"Wanting to fly doesn't make you immature.\" It's wanting to fly without putting in the effort to build wings that makes you immature. And we can dream big. We have big aspirations for life. But when you look at the obstacles to get there, you have to ask yourself, are you willing to do what it takes? You know, we have the greatest hope any person could ever have and that is our salvation. But sometimes we think about that dream and that hope and we look at the effort that it takes to build the wings to get there and like maybe not maybe someone else can do it. Maybe if I can grow wings but no God wants you to put in the effort to get there. Let's go. Let's go back to second Peter chapter 2. And then the other part of the passage, you know, Peter lifts up Paul, which is pretty incredible because uh Paul is the one that rebukes Peter to his face for his prejudice. And so it's really cool to see how far Peter has come in realizing his faults in realizing where he's gone wrong to the point to where he literally says that uh Paul's writings are also true. And that's how much uh how much you can change if you take a duke. Amen. And uh and after that it says in verse 17, \"Therefore, dear friends, since you know this in advance, be on your guard. So you are not led away by the error of lost people and fall from your own stable position, but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and the day of eternity.\" Point number two is simply grow. Grow. So we have to know how to make every effort, but we also have to grow. And it says to grow in the grace. And honestly, when I first read that, I'm like, how do you grow in grace? Because Jesus, God is the one who gives grace. How can I grow in something that is given to me? Well, the word grace is just cherished and it just means God's favor. And when I think of God's favor, I think of the Old Testament where it talks about blessings, you know, gaining an inheritance. That is something that's also given to you. So, let's go to Deuteronomy 28. How can we grow in God's grace? In Deuteronomy chapter 28, you know, in this passage is quite fascinating because in the chapter about 25% of the chapter, you know, God talks about the blessings for obedience and in the other 75% God talks about the curses for disobedience. And it really makes you think because obeying God is quite simple. And the blessings are are not complicated at all. But then the reason why he expands so much on the curses for disobedience is because once you disobey, life gets pretty complicated. Life gets pretty difficult. And in verse one of chapter 28 says, \"Now if you faithfully obey the Lord your God and are careful to follow all his commands I am giving you today, the Lord your God will put you far above the nations of the earth. All these blessings will come and overtake you because you obey the Lord your God.\" So when I think of growing in the grace, I think the only way to grow in favor received from God, grace received from God is by our obedience. The more we obey, the more grace that we have, the more grace that we get. And of course, God gives us all you know according to what we have. But then we grow in our obedience. Even Jesus became complete through his obedience. Amen. And then other part said growing in our knowledge of our Lord. So it's not just knowledge of our Lord but it is knowledge that is from the Lord. So in Proverbs chapter 2 let's go there. What is knowledge from the Lord? Proverbs chapter 2 it says in verse 6 the Bible reads for the Lord gives wisdom. From his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. So it's not just knowledge of God but it is knowledge that is from God. So if I think about how can we grow in this? How can we grow in grace which we get from our obedience to God? How can we grow in our knowledge which we also have to receive from God? I simply think of great quietness having great times in the word of God. And I find many people ask themselves how can I have great quiet times? How can I have deep quiet times? And I actually don't think that is the proper question to ask because growing comes from learning. So if the issue is how can we have great quiet times, how do you quiet time? How can we learn from God? It's not how can we do it, but what is keeping you from learning from God? Because it's not God's word's fault that we're not learning. It is our fault. And so if if we're having a struggle growing with God, we don't look to God and say, \"What the heck, God?\" We look to ourselves. But what is keeping us from learning? I find that there are three reasons why people don't learn and don't change and don't grow with God. And I do not make up these reasons. Go to Matthew chapter 13. The Bible has the answers. Amen. Imagine something. You know, I can donate if I if I do something like say please say something. You know, I got plenty of brothers. I I'm grateful for Anthony. Anthony, you know, he'll come up and say, \"Brother, you know, I'm so glad you wore black shoes on.\" And I said, \"Amen.\" You know, this is the the Goodwill promo. Amen. Um but uh Matthew 13 it says in verse 18 uh so listen to the parable of the swer when anyone hears the word about the kingdom and doesn't understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart this is the one sown along the path and the one sown uh on the rocky grounds this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy but he has no root and is shortlived when distress or perssecution comes because of the word immediately he falls away. Now the one sown among the thorns this is the one who hears the word but the worries of this age and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word and it becomes unfruitful. I believe that these are the three reasons why people don't change. The first one is the past. The first reason why I believe that people don't change is simply because they have a hard hustle. They are unwilling to change. They have become numb to their sin. They have become blind to their sin. And they now are living in a state to where they don't even see a reason to even try. That they are totally unwilling to even change. The the second reason why I believe people are unwilling to change. It talks about the the soil that has a rocky that has rocks in it. The rocky soil and it says the issue with them is that they have no roots. The reason number two they have no roots, but rather they don't have enough space for roots because it's not that there are rocks that are on top of the soil because if you put a seed on a rock and you put a seed on a path out so the seed is actually in the soil but there's rocks in the soil and so when the seed start to sprout instead of getting the good soil it just rocks and I believe that there are many rocks that people can have in their lives things that keep them truly committed to God. It could be different kinds of obstacles. It could be convictions that they have that are contrary to the word of God. It could be a belief system contrary to the word of God. It can be relationships, people in their lives. It can be habits. It can be anything to where when hardships, when distress and persecution and hard times come, instead of going to yourself because the heart represents the soil, you go deeper within yourself. And as we learned earlier, uh brokenness is what you see who truly God instead of bringing you to a state of brokenness, you hit a rock. You hit a part of your life that is not what God wants to be, not something that God wants to have in your life. You know, if I gave you a pot of soil, a simple pot, and I said, \"Take out the rocks.\" You might ask, \"Well, how many are there?\" Well, how how big do I leave the small? Well, how long will it take? I don't know. You know, when you're dealing with rocks in your life, it's a long process to get them all out. And you know, I I love this passage because, you know, there's a simple way to actually help someone like that. You have to put in love and care to take the rocks out of your life, to actually help somebody. And even for yourself, you take the rocks out of your own life. And you have to be patient with yourself. You have to be forgiving of yourself. And the only way to help yourself or someone who lost in their life is the long process of love, patience, and help. You know, the third reason why I believe that people uh don't change and they don't learn and don't grow is the third is the soil with thorns. And what it is that have thorns, it says that you're you're choked out. You're choked out. And what happens is you have the soil, but there's thorns at a certain limit. And what it means is that you grow and you grow the soil is fine but there's a painful point where once you get to a certain point it hurts and you don't like being there. So you withdraw yourself to a comfortable level where you feel like everything's fine and you know uh we do that to avoid that pain to avoid that discomfort to live at a comfortable level in life. And you know, we have deeper roots. We have enough space for roots. But those roots, they cause us to grow taller. And they cause us to go stronger like the tree that God wants us to be. But what happens is, you know, when you become stronger and taller, you become more committed. And when you become more committed, you know, that's talking about weekly contribution. That's giving benevolence. That's giving missions. That's that's raising money for missions. That's that's setting aside time in your schedule to share your fa to be in Bible stud. quiet time and you look at all of that and you're like, you know what, I'm going to stay at this level. That that is too much for me to be at. And so the worries of this world, you seek wealth, it chokes you out, you know, and what happens is we forget the promise that God will take care of you and so the reality is those things they are in some sense understandable why we But the issue is to overcome that through obeying God's promise of seek first kingdom and he will you know I remember um when we were in India one of the things that was super special while we were there if you look it up right now one of the top crimes that India is known for is very general crimes against women very general and so I just got married I don't want to lose my life. Amen. When we moved to India and you know there would be times when she would have she would have times with the the team and she would go through really bad parts of India and I had to really learn to just pray. I had to really learn to rely on God and you know it's quite difficult but I have to understand that this is where my belief in God is put do I really trust that God can answer my pray it's easy when we're living here but it's difficult when it's completely out of your control and so I had to learn this so even I love all these different soils because out of the four of them including the good soil you know three of them become the rocky soil, they gain roots. The the thorny soil, they also gain roots and the thorns. Of course, it's a good soil. And so I found myself, even though I could be in the good soil, I could go right back to the I can make my heart go right back to the rock. And so we have to actually help ourselves go through the different stages. Let me get out the rocks. Let me move up the good planted soil. Amen. Let's go to Proverbsapter 8. Because there is a solution for all of it. No matter what kind of heart you have, what kind of soil that you're working with that the sea is planted in your heart, there is one solution. Every single one of us is different. We all have to approach our problems in a very different way. But God has given us all one Bible, one word. So there is one solution. And in Proverbsapter 8, one of my favorite scriptures, he says in verse 10, accept my instruction instead of silver and knowledge rather than pure gold, for wisdom is better than jewels and nothing desirable. You know, I love passages like this because uh it really deals with how much do you desire God? The solution to no matter where heart is at, you have to ask yourself, how much do I desire God? How much do I desire instruction from him? How much do I desire to obey him? And to the point to where no other desire can even come close to this. That is the solution. No matter where your heart is at, no matter if you're struggling to grow, you're struggling to give every effort, you have to ask yourself, how much do I truly desire? And I find that a lot of our issues because that desire has gone down because our our our roots can't grow hard enough and long enough and now it hits rocks. We can't grow tall enough and strong enough because we hit or maybe our heart is hard all together and we don't even give the seed of the word a chance. But the way to overcome that is do you desire God? Do you desire him more than anything else? Because you know wisdom from God instruction from the Lord. It is more precious than anything you could ever have. And you know, we talked about it, you know, last Sunday. It's like walking around with tons of money, but no one can steal it from you. But with something so invaluable that anyone can and anyone might want to have and they can put all their effort into taking, but they can never take that is totally in your control as long as you desire God. And so we have to abandon our thoughts. We have to get rid of the rocks in our soil. We have to soften our hard heart so we may grow in God and grow with God. And if you can grow in God now, you can learn to give every single effort because that is what it takes of us. That is what it requires of us to even start to run away from our sinful nature. And if you can make every single effort and if you can grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, then I believe that you will be, as the scripture says, found without spot or blemish. Imagine that in the sight of Jesus Christ, you can be found completely without a single blemish in your life. Why? Because of how much effort you put into your how much you desire God.",

    "series_number": 43,
    "transcript": "Who here has ever thought about giving up? Who here has ever thought that your effort sometimes means nothing? Who here sometimes when they're putting in as much work as they can feels overwhelmed, stressed, or anxious? Okay, I'm glad I'm not alone. Okay, you know, I I wanted to share about something that I learned a few months ago reflecting on these questions for myself, and I pray that it could help you today as well. Please turn to John chapter 6. My title for us today is mana from heaven. Mana from heaven. I can't split bread into a million pieces. So, but uh it says in John chapter 6 in verse 22, the next day the crowd had stayed on the other side of the sea where they had been only one boat. They also saw that Jesus had not boarded the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone off alone. Some boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boat and went to Cabernam looking for Jesus. When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\" Jesus answered, \"Truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled. Don't work for food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set his seal of approval on him.\" \"What can we do to perform the works of God?\" they asked. Jesus replied, \"This is the work of God that you believe in the one he has sent.\" See, in in this passage, Jesus performed the miracle of feeding 5,000 people, literally taking a handful of fish, a handful of bread loaves, and split it amongst 5,000 people where they ate and were filled. And then he literally leaves the sink, just goes and he's gone. And no one knows where he goes. But his disciples, they get in a boat and they travel to him. And but on their way to find where he's at, Jesus meets them walking on water. So he performs these backtoback miracles. And here we are with the crowd that he just finished feeding being left behind. And they're trying to find him, too. And they see these boats lying there. and their eagerness to find Jesus, to look for him, to hear what he has to say, see what he has to do. They see these boats lying there from Tiberius and they just take him. They see the boats and they just take the boats and they go and travel to him. That's how eager they were to find Jesus. But it says in verse 26, why were they actually looking for him? It says, \"Because you ate the loaves and were filled.\" And in a very literal sense, they were looking for Jesus because of food, because he fed them. And at this time, the the the Romans, they occupied Judah and like an imperial army and they put on these heavy taxes. They oppressed them. And so here comes Jesus, a man that literally fed 5,000 people with a handful of fish and bread. And so they see Jesus like, you know what, this man, he will feed me. He will grant me a way that I can escape this oppression from the Romans. He will give me a a sense of freedom as long as I follow him. And he continues to feed me. And I find that many Jesus and sometimes even us in our hardest times, we want Jesus to be someone that simply fixes our problems. Like I said, we feel stressed, overwhelmed. We want to give up. And we're crying out to God, if only he could take it away from us, take away this feeling, this physical pressure, and this physical struggle struggle away from us. But that is not the God or the Jesus that we worship. He He is not there so we can he can fix all our problems. In fact, these people they they followed him. And it wasn't just that they wanted Jesus to fix their problems, but they did it without being willing to fix themselves. And uh you know what this does is you go to Jesus and you look for him to find a way to feel good about yourselves, to feel better about yourselves. And you know, you take what you can and then you leave and then you do something terrible and you feel terrible again and you go right back to him as if Jesus is some sort of genie in a bottle, as if he's someone that just beckons your call. And instead of you serving him, now you've rededuced Jesus that he now serves you. And the reason why you keep running back to him is because feeling good about yourself doesn't make life fulfilling. Feeling good about yourself doesn't make life fulfilling. And he has something to offer them if they would only pay attention to his words. That he has food that endures to eternal life. He has something to offer them where they don't have to keep running to him empty, running to him hungry, having a relationship with Jesus where it's constantly giving and being given to. And then once you go out, you continue your week, you continue your day, you feel drained again, and then you continue to use him like a dirty rag. But he says that he has food for eternal life that we must work for. And I find this is interesting because he says in verse 29 that that work of God is to believe in the one that he has sent. And if you can do that, you will always be fulfilled. Point number one, always fulfilled. You know, I believe that Satan has done a number on this word belief. Well, what does it mean to believe, right? And you know, people when back in the day when they really believed in something, they stood up for us. When they saw injustice, they said something. When they saw discrimination, they did something. If you really believe it. when they saw mass genocide, when they saw oppression and terrorism, if someone believed in what they knew was right, they stood up for it. And many men and women today fought for many causes that brought us uh the ability to do what we're doing right now because they not only believed in something and they dreamed of something better, but they achieved it. They went after with all their hearts. But what is believing now? Believing is now simply a feeling that you get when you know something's real. It's now just a feeling. It's just internal. And it's like, you know, you really believe when your favorite Christian worship song comes on, you know, that that feeling increases, you know, or or or maybe you watch a really inspiring movie and it drives you, it motivates you, but only for a short time while you while it's still fresh in your mind. And then after a few days it fizzles out because you come to now face reality. Uh and I think obviously for many people in the religious world it could be a miraculous event that that has caused them it has brought them the tears and even goosebumps but it is still just a feeling. And I find that none of these things are bad in and of themselves but it's not true belief when it leads to nothing. It's not biblical belief when you can do nothing with it and you choose to do nothing with it. It becomes like a a spark that could ignite a fire but it just fades away. Or you know you're about to go to bed, you get a nice cold glass of water and you but you let it sit and you come back to it the next day and now it's warm and you could have enjoyed that refreshing water but now it's no longer refreshing. Now you might want to put some more ice cubes in it. Amen. But that's not the kind of belief that we want to have. We want the belief that Jesus has to offer us that lasts forever because belief in Jesus is not the other beliefs. It is the work of God to believe in Jesus. Believing is a work. Believing is a work. And when you know that Jesus walked this earth, you know his teachings and you know that his promises are true, it's not a feeling, it's a practice. When when you when you actually believe it and you take it to hearts and it's not just something that fizzles and goes away, it becomes part of who you are. It is a work. It is a practice. And I find that your effort towards that practice is what keeps you always fulfilled. You know, I'll ask you guys a question. What is the one thing in life you can't control? Not death. You can't control death. It could happen to you any moment. What's the one thing in life that you can control? You can control. What is yourself, the one thing in life gun pointed to your head and the worst scenario, you have full control over what you do. Even in the worst situations, you have full control. And so I find this statement to be true. The amount of effort that one puts in their walk with God, it determines their fulfillment. Because you know, our our fulfillment now is based off of your choices rather than what is done to you. And some choices, they give you long-term fulfillment, short-term fulfillment, or zero fulfillment. But there is only one choice that gives you eternal fulfillment, and that is the work of believing in Jesus. So this is what we learn from the Bible is that you can have a completely fulfilling life if you do what Jesus says. And I find when life isn't fulfillment fulfilling is because your effort towards believing in Jesus has gone down. And that our Christian walk is learning how to get fulfillment purely from believing and obeying Jesus. Because that is one thing that you can control. You can't control if people around you are following Jesus. You can't control if people are sinning against you. You can't control if you lose a job. You can't control if you know they're doing layoffs. You can't control as the equitable sharing if you have all these uh insurance claims. But you can control what you do when these things happen to you. And that even if the worst things happen to you, if you're stressed, overwhelmed, anxious, you feel like you want to quit, you might want to stop, you're tempted with sin, maybe you even do it a few times, but you don't know if you want to come back to God, that you can be fulfilled if you make the right decision. See, I love that that's what Jesus is offering to us because he allows us to experience him and being like him as long as we choose to do it. and that being like Jesus can be simply a choice. Being fulfilled can simply be a choice. And uh I'm I'm going to embarrass myself a little bit, but who likes anime here? I like anime. Okay, a good maybe oneird one/4 the room. Okay, I'm not you know Elizabeth was saying like it's it's okay to be awkward, you know, to express the weird parts of yourself. I like anime and one of my favorite animes is One Piece. I love One Piece. No thumbs down to One Piece. One Piece actually is one of the most sold pieces of fiction of all time. Like above Superman comics, above the Odyssey, above the Iliad, it is literally one of the most sold piece. So even if you don't like anime, you cannot say that it's objectively bad. You can in your opinion, but you know, Amen. Let's look at the facts here. Amen. But, you know, I in in the show, not many shows do you really like make the main character your favorite character, but in One Piece, the main character is my favorite character. Luffy L, his name is Luffy, and he's he's the goat. Luffy's just the goat. And Luffy, from the very first episode, has this dream to become the pirate king. And at first, I didn't want to watch One Piece because I'm I don't want to watch a show about pirates, like anime pirates. It sounds kind of weird. But then I just watched because everyone liked it. so much. It was good. But the pirate king, he's not like going around plundering all these other pirates, all these other nations. But to him, a pirate king is someone that's unrestricted by the law, unrestricted by anyone trying to enforce rules on him. To him, the pirate king is the most free man on earth. And so he wants to be the pirate king because he wants to be so and and so so free, the most free person to ever live. And but in doing that he has to face enemy after enemy because everyone else is trying to be the pirate king. And so in his striving to be pirate king he just takes them down you know or if anyone wants to stop him or doesn't like you know what he's doing because in his fighting for his own freedom he sees other people's freedom oppressed and he literally fights for their freedom as well even at the risk of his own life. And at one point someone asked why would you do something so dangerous? you could die. What's the point of striving for something if you could die in the process? And I love what the author wrote uh for what he said. Said, \"If I die trying, then at least I try.\" And it's this way of thinking that I think is super important even for us disciples that it doesn't matter how difficult it may be that at the end of the day, if you made the right decision, you know that it's good and you know that God wanted you to do this. No, no matter how difficult it is, no matter how embarrassing it is, that making the right decision is all you need to tell yourself, \"At least I died trying.\" And that the only thing that could have stopped me was myself. I let nothing else stop me. So life will throw at you trial after trial. You may want to slow down, throw in the towel. You may want to put disciplehip on the back burner to focus on your your own life. But at the end of the day, if you make the right decision, you know, you can go to God at the end of the day. Go to God in prayer and say, \"You know what, God? I know I did all that I could. I feel fulfilled. I might feel a little stressed, but it's okay. I know I'm living according to your word. I know I have all these trials happening in my life or all these things I'm tempted with, whether it be my family, whether it be my job, all these different things. But I know that I'm right with you. I'm making the decisions you want me to make. And I find that it is in those moments when you get the most trials where you're tested if belief for you is either a feeling or a practice. And you cannot let fulfillment be based on your emotional level but on your effort level. Amen. Because if you let it be based on your effort, it'll always be in your control. Fulfillment is always in your control if you base it off of your efforts. Like we all want to have a full life. Amen. But imagine that that you can have it based off of what you do and how you live and the decisions that you make. So let's have a fulfilling life. Make those tough decisions. You know, when you see a person there and you you feel embarrassed to show your faith, share your faith even if they say no. Because when you go to bed, you're like, \"At least I tried it.\" You know, you might be tempted with being impatient, tested in lashing out in anger and being lazy and procrastinating or whatever it is, but make the right decision. You're like, you know what? At least I did my absolute best and that's what it matters most. Point number two, the test of God's mana. Let's keep reading in John 6. In verse 30, uh, right after that, it says, \"What sign then are you going to do so that we may see and believe you?\" They asked, \"What are you going to perform? Our ancestors ate mana, ate the mana in the wilderness, just as it is written, he gave them mana from heaven to eat.\" Jesus said to them, \"Truly I tell you, Moses didn't give you the bread from heaven, but my father gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life uh to the worlds. Uh then they said, \"Sir, give us this bread always. I am the bread of life.\" Jesus told them, \"No one who comes to me will ever be hungry and no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again.\" Point number two, the test of God's mana. See, Jesus says that he is the bread of life that that if they want to always have this bread where they're always fulfilled and they don't have to keep running back to him, if you want to always be living in the state of satisfaction and living life to the full is you have to go to Jesus, that he is the only way. But they referenced uh something that happened in the Old Testament. So, let's go there. Let's go to Exodus chapter 16. Let's see what they're referencing here. In Exodus 16 and verse one, the Bible reads, \"The entire Israelite community departed from Elim and came to the wilderness of sin, which is between Elim and Si. On the 15th day of the second month after they had left the land of Egypt, the entire Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. The Israelites said to them, \"If only we had died by the Lord's hand in the land of Egypt. when we sat by pots of meat and ate all the bread we wanted. Instead, you brought us into this wilderness to make the whole assembly die of hunger. Then the Lord said to Moses, \"I am going to raid bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. This way I will test them to see whether or not they will follow my instructions.\" See, you know, this passage is interesting and this is where we get introduced to mana that God gave, right? And it says that after two months and 15 days, they finally are saying, \"Moses, where's the food?\" And even if you think about that, they went two months and 15 days in the wilderness with very little provisions, with simply what they could carry when they left Egypt. Two months and 15 days. And the Bible even says that in their 40 years of being in the wilderness, he didn't let their clothes get worn out or their sandals get worn out. And so, literally, God was sustaining them in miraculous ways. But yet, they come to Moses and they grumble before Moses and like, \"What the heck, Moses? We're hungry. Why didn't you let us die by the Lord's hands?\" And I find one of the first tests of God's mana is who do you rely on? Who do you look to? Who who do you look for reassurance from? Who do you look for for strength from? Who do you blame for all your issues? Because the real real the reality was why they had no food is because God was testing them to see what were they going to do when they were hungry. But they can't go to God and grumble because if you go to God and grumble, you know you're wrong. Amen. So they picked someone to blame and they picked Moses and they failed the tests. And we're going to see in even in this simple passage how many times they were tested by God's mana. And I find it's helpful, you know, to read the whole thing. Amen. We're not going to read all of chapter 16 right now, but I would, you know, hope in your own free time to go back and read it. But we're going to jump around in verse 8. This look what it says. It says, \"Most continued, the Lord will give you meat to eat this evening and all the bread you want in the morning. For he has heard the complaints that you are uh raising against him. Who are we that your complaint that your complaints are not against us but against the Lord?\" And so literally God's okay, you don't like you know that the fact that you're hungry. You will not only have mana in the mornings, but I will give you meat in the evenings. And what would happen was is if you try to hold the mana until the evening that it would rot. And if you tried to hold the quail, the meat that would come down the evenings until the morning, then it would go bad. Right? And what happened was in verse 20, people still tried it. They literally still tried to hold the mana longer or to hold the quailes longer. And they still failed God's test. Before they had it, they failed it. And then when they had it, they failed. And literally, you know what happens is we have a God that tests us. Many people, we love the God that is merciful towards us, that is gracious toward us, but what about the God that tests you, that wants to see who you truly put your faith in? And in verse 27, you know, uh God even said during the Sabbath, don't go out. There won't be food. just gathered twice as many men the day before and then they still failed God's test. They literally went out on the Sabbath day to see if anything was there. As if somehow miraculously if they just tried it, it would just somehow work. And I find that you know what happens another test that we have is we try to push the limits of God's commands. Another test of God's mana is literally do you try to find workarounds God's commandments? Uh do you find ways in look for maybe loopholes? Well, the Bible literally says that it's an utter refusal. In verse 28, this is what God has to say for those who do that. It literally says, \"Then the Lord said to Moses,\" how long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my instructions? God views those who look for loopholes and workarounds as a refusal to obey him. That is one of the tests of mana. But in verse 31, it's kind of interesting. Says, \"The house of Israel named the substance mana. It resembled coriander seed, was white, and tasted like wafers with made with honey. That sounds pretty good. Like literally, imagine God said, \"All right, you're hungry. I'm going to give you honey vanilla wafers every morning and you're going to be totally healthy and you're going to make it to promises.\" Like, that'd be awesome, you know? Like, what more could I want? Like, basically have something sweet, something light. See, me personally, I like sweets, but I like the subtle sweets. I like the um the oldfashioned donuts that have no glaze on them. It sounds kind of weird, but it's because I can eat so many of them and it's like it's not overly sweet where it's overbearing. My favorite cereal, funny enough, is the frosted mini wheats because they're slightly sweet, but it's mainly wheat and you could just eat bowl after bowl after bowl and not feel bad about yourself because it's not doesn't feel super sugary. And God was doing the same thing for them. You know, he said, \"It's not super sweet. It's light. It's flaky. You know, it's going to be very nice and you could have it every single day. That'd be awesome. But they grumbled. And they hated it. You know, I find that one of the tests of God's mana is to see will you truly rely on what he gives you or will you just find something to complain about? There's always something to complain about if you look hard enough. You know, there was this case study of this man and he told he gathered a bunch of women. I think about seven women said, \"Okay, we're going to put a scar on your face and uh you know, makeup scar and you're going to go on these interviews. I want you to see if anyone judges you differently.\" So, they did the whole makeup and everything and they looked at it. Oh, that's terrible. And okay, wait, actually, come back. We're going to do some touch-up. And they removed the scar without them going back to the mirror. So when they go to these interviews, they're fully convinced that the scar is still on the face. And so when they come back from the interviews and they the the guy asked them to report their findings, every single one of them agreed that they felt prejudice because of the scar on their face. And then what it revealed was that if you like look for something hard enough, you will find it. They they were they were and they're like, \"Oh, like they they they were prejudiced towards me because of my scar. They thought because of my looks were this way, because of my scar.\" But the scar was not there at all. It was completely removed. But why did they say that is because they were looking for us. You know, if you look for an issue, you will find us. You will guaranteed find us. And one of the tests of mana is even as it says later on in the Bible is think about what is, you know, what is encouraging. Think about what is good, what is lovely, what is kind. And that even if in all the bad things you could focus on, you have to focus on the good things. Amen. And in verse 35, let's see what it says. The Israelites ate mana for 40 years until they came to inhabited lands. They ate mana until they reached the border of the land of Canaan. So God sustained them for 40 years off of mana. So what do we learn? And why is Jesus comparing himself to the mana that God gave is because from slavery to the promised land, they were sustained off of mana. So just like us, the day that we're baptized into the day that we go to heaven were sustained off of Jesus, the bread of life. And the Bible is full of Old Testament figures and symbols that represent Jesus later on. One of them being mana. And if you dig hard enough and you keep on reading the Bible, you will find in every single book something represents Jesus. And it's really cool. But let's keep let's keep going to Numbers chapter 11, the test of God's manner. In Numbers 11, what we're going to look at is a parallel passage. Just like how the Gospels were all records of Jesus's life, some have similarities, some have differences to highlight different ways of viewing what Jesus did. It's the same thing with some of the books in the in the Old Testament as well. So, this is the same account of Exodus 16, but in the book of Numbers. And in verse four, uh I like reading different translations. You know, this one says the the riffraff among them. Some might say the troublemakers. This says the riffraff. Amen. Sometimes you have riff riffraff amongst the congregation. Amen. And it says the riffrock among them had a strong craving for other food. The Israelites wept again and said, \"Who will feed us meats? We remember the free fish we ate in Egypt along with the cucumbers, melons, leaks, onions. I don't know why they're just eating onions, but and garlic.\" And they they're starving. But now our appetite is gone. There's nothing to look at but this mana. You know, one of the other tests of mana is you look at your days in darkness only. They literally are reminiscing about eating garlic and leaks and onions. Have you guys ever had an onion plane? Just like just taking a bite out of it. I remember when I was a kid, I thought I could tough it out. I was like, you know, mom, give me that onion. to try it. And I really tried to put on a this tough face, but I was crying on the inside. That was terrible. And you know, they look back at that fondly. Why? Because they hated God's test. See, when you're going through trials, you know, it's going to see God wants to see if whether you're going to look back at your time in darkness fondly or look at the test and overcome the tests. And it says in verse 18, same chapter says, \"Tell the people, consecrate yourselves in readiness for tomorrow, and you will eat meat because you wept in the Lord's hearing. Who will feed us meats? We are better off than Egypt. The Lord will give you meats and you will eat. You will eat not for one day or two days or five days or 10 days or 20 days but for a whole month until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes nauseating to you because you have rejected the Lord who is among you and wept before him. Why did we ever leave Egypt? See the test of God's mana is to be s sustained by what he has to give you and what he has to give you alone. And of course, if we know that God's mana now is Jesus, is are you allowing Jesus to be the one that sustains you? And the truth is that when you desire something else, as we learn in this passage, God actually gives it to you. That when they said, \"God, we hate this man. We're tired of looking at it. We would rather eat onions.\" God says, \"Okay, I'll give you meat. I'm going to give you so much meat it's going to come out of your nostrils. It's going to be nauseating to you. And we learned that it rained down every evening and you know some people they have these nice farms. They go to their chicken coops, they get the you know chickens and they go and they make it and they eat it, right? But imagine if every morning it rained chickens and then all the community had to scramble and go catch them. You know, you see those uh things on TV or Instagram and they're in like a machine that the money's flying everywhere. Imagine every evening for dinner you had to go do that this quail flying everywhere. You're just trying to catch whatever you can, you know, it's kind of a free-for-all. And God's like, \"It's going to be nauseating to you. You want it, but you're not going to like it.\" And you know, I find this interesting because God chose mana because it was light. He knew what was good for us, but yet the people still complains. And you know, the truth is when you desire something else, not only does God give it to you, but he'll even do it, but it doesn't mean that he condones it. And in verse 32, uh same chapter, the Bible says, \"The people were up all uh up up all that day and night, and all the next day gathering the the quill.\" Once again, it was a scramble. It was tough. It wasn't easy. And it literally says after that, uh, after they gathered the quail, uh, the one who took the least gathered 60 bushels and they spread them out all on the ground camp, all around the camp. While the meat was still between their teeth before it was chewed, the Lord's anger burned against the people and the Lord struck them with a severe plague. Literally, they begged to God for something because they refused to obey his commands. And God said, \"Here you go.\" And while they were still eating it, a plague just happened while it was still in between their teeth. And I find God is not the God that walks around and puts all his children on leashes the way that some parents do when they go on a on a tour, right? And they have a wild kid and they're just like, you know, you're just going to stay next to me. God's not going to do that. If you want to go, you can go, but you're not going to like it. And in fact, you you will face consequences for it. But if you want it so bad, here you go. Let's go to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2. In 2 Thessalonians chapter 2, I find this to be one of the more challenging scriptures in the Bible. says, \"The coming of the lawless one in verse 9, the coming of the lawless one is based on Satan's working with every kind of miracle, both signs and wonders serving the lie.\" So see like literally Satan is trying to get people to be convinced of a lie. And with every wicked deception among those who are perishing, they perish because they did not accept the love of the truth and so be saved. So there are these people who reject God's truth and they refuse to obey it. And then Satan says this is great. They believe in the lie. And so Satan, it says that he will perform these miracles so that you will believe in the lie because you refuse to obey the truth. And if you keep reading, it says in verse 11, for this reason God God sends them a strong delusion so that they will believe the lie. so that all will be condemned. Those who did not believe the truth but delighted in unrighteousness. You see what happens when you continue in disobedience. And not only do you continue in it, but you want to believe that is true. Satan performs miracles to get you to believe it. And then God sees that because of your stubborn refusal to believe the truth. Says, \"Okay, hear that. Here's this. I want you to believe it even more because you refuse to believe in the truth. And God wants all people to be saved. But he doesn't force your hands. He wants you to come into the truth. But if you refuse, and that's the the key difference here. Why does God send the delusion is because of their refusal to obey the truth. And why is it so important to to actually endure the test of God's mana of realizing that Jesus is the only one that could sustain us? Because if you don't realize it, then you will start to believe in a lie. And when you believe in that lie, Satan works hard to get you to believe in it further. And then God is upset. He's angry. He says, \"You know what? Fine. Here you go. Full vent to your ways. Take it. The the life of darkness is now all yours.\" In fact, it's not just all yours, but you will live in a state of mind where you believe that it's totally okay and you will love living that way. See, we must be careful not to lie to ourselves, saying that we believe in him, but delight in wickedness. You know, I I try to be careful and not ask people this question. Are you happy? Because if you ask them, they will most times say yes, even if they're not. And you know there is a man who you know went around asking the transgender community are you happy and they would say yes. But if you go to a hospital psych ward majority of the patients about 30% of the patients in a hospital psych ward uh profess themselves as transgender. But yet if you go on the street they all say they're happy. They all say they're doing fine and they're loving life. And so there's there's this state that happens when you love wickedness. You believe you're okay. You believe in a lie. And God wants you to repent, but he won't force your hands. You have to see it for yourself. Let's go to Revelation chapter 3. Revelation chapter 3 in uh verse 17 right after you know the famous passage on being lukewarm and not and you know don't be um you know lukewarm and you're not hot or cold and God wants to vomit you out. It says in verse 17, \"For you say,\"I rich. I have become wealthy and need nothing, and you don't realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked. I advise you to buy from me gold refined in the fire so that you may be rich. White clothes so that you may be dressed and your shameful nakedness not be exposed and ointment to spread on your eyes so that you may see. See what happens when you fail the test of God's mana of relying solely on Jesus is you start to tell yourself that you're doing pretty good. that life is just fine the way that it is. But God is saying, \"Open your eyes. I I advise you.\" Once again, he's not forcing you. God literally Jesus says, \"I advise you.\" Imagine that Jesus comes to you because, \"Hey, I want to give you some advice. I'm not going to force you. I'm not going to make you. I want to give you some advice. Buy gold for me refined by fire.\" And let's let's let's learn what this goal is. Let's close out in 1 Peter 1. 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse says you rejoice in this even though now for a short time if necessary you suffer in grief in various trials to the proven character of your faith more valuable than gold which though perishable is refined by fire may result in praise glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ though you have not seen him. You love him. Though not seeing him now, you believe in him and you rejoice with inexpressable and glorious joy because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls. You see, you know, Jesus is saying that your faith will be put on trial. And what is a trial trying to determine is if your faith, if your belief is a feeling or a practice. And when it's a practice, it is worth more than gold. And that is why you're fulfilled. You know, moving to India for a time, we had to bring uh the best way to actually transfer your money is literally withdrawing a ton of money from the banks here in America, taking wads of cash over the plane and then getting it exchanged in India. And it's quite scary because you're on the plane knowing that you have thousands of dollars. pretty much all of your bank accounts is in a single bag and you're doing the best you can to pretend like it's not there so no one takes it, no one thinks anything fishy of it, right? And you're guarding it with your life. But the Bible says that a faith refined by fire cannot be stolen from you because it is based off of your own decisions. It is something that cannot be taken. It is something that that cannot like literally be sought after and find finding a way to when you're not paying attention take it away from you. But it is solely based off of what you do and your own efforts. So you are literally walking around with wads of cash, millions of millions upon dollars in an airport where everyone is thinking, can I take something from them? Can I take something from them? And you're like, you can try. You can't take anything from me. That is what it's like to have faith refined by fire. to have belief that is a work and not a feeling because literally it says that though you've seen him though you have not seen him you love him and that is faith. Though you don't see him now you still believe in him and and you know that he is guarding your soul once you go on to glory and you rejoice with inexpressable and glorious joy because you have something that cannot be taken. It cannot be stolen. And yet, it's also invaluable, worth more than anything you could ever have. Because the goal of your faith, the work of all of our belief, it is a salvation of our souls. When you put your faith into practice, and you don't let it be just a feeling. You live based off of your effort level instead of your emotional level. Then guess what? God will give you the reward for your faith. And that is salvation. And that's why you walk around fulfilled. No matter what happens to you, no matter how overwhelmed you may be, how overstressed, how anxious, how much you want to quit, you you feel totally fine because of what you're doing for God. So let's let our belief be worked out to his complete end for the salvation of our souls. To God be all the glory.",

    "summary": "This sermon, \"Manna From Heaven,\" encourages disciples to find true and lasting fulfillment by actively believing and obeying Jesus, rather than seeking Him to merely fix problems or provide temporary good feelings. Using the Israelites' experience with manna in the wilderness, the speaker illustrates God's tests of reliance and highlights the consequences of grumbling, seeking loopholes, and desiring alternatives to God's perfect provision. The core message is that belief is a continuous 'work' or practice, not just an emotion, and cultivating this 'faith refined by fire' ensures an unshakable, invaluable fulfillment in salvation that remains in one's control amidst life's trials.",

    "title": "What Does The Resurrection Mean?",
    "speaker": "Malik Speckman | Sunday Sermon",
    "church": "Tampa Bay ICC",
    "book_reference": null,
    "series_number": 44,
    "transcript": "Please turn your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4. You know, today, as you might be guessing, I will be talking about the resurrection. To no one's surprise, amen. It is Easter Sunday. And you know, everyone says, you know, every day is Easter Sunday. We should always celebrate the resurrection. You know, today I'm going to talk about why do we talk about the resurrection? What does the resurrection mean? That is my title for you guys today. What does the resurrection mean? And you know, talking to different people, meeting many who profess a faith in Christ, who believe in some sense in Jesus's resurrection. I find that this meaning of why he has done it and what it means for us is a little bit lost. So, we're going to study that out today. And what it is that people want is sadly no longer truth. People no longer seek a truth in today's world. And what it is that people want is they want their own meaning. They look at their own emotions, their own desires, and what they find is some meaning in their life that combines all that they want, what's going on internally. But the resurrection calls you to look outwards. It calls you to stop looking for your own personal and internal meaning and look for an eternal truth. You know, I find that, you know, people want less and less to do with God, their creator. And what it does is it increases the callousness of their hearts. They become more and more hard-hearted. People desire what benefits them even at the cost of other people. You know, uh people no one respects the family model anymore. You have men that don't want to lead, don't want to stand up for what is right. And because of that, you have women trying to take control because of men's lack of leadership. And what it creates for all of society are children that are broken, children that are confused, taken advantage of, and constantly in suffering. And what it creates inside not only these children, but I find in many of us today is low self-esteem because they're hoping for someone to tell them that they mean something, tell them that they matter and everyone else is looking for their own personal meaning that they can't uh cater to those around them. And so therefore, this low self-esteem creates this narcissism. And then all of a sudden, everyone wants attention going to themselves because they're trying to answer this one question. Do I bring value in this world? Am I truly wanted? Am I liked the way that I am? Meanwhile, God, he is in agony because he is a jealous God. Meaning, he created us for himself, but we turn to other things and he's like, \"How could you do this? You belong to me. And this God, he created the whole world and he has called all of us, everyone on this planet to be pure, to be righteous and to be full of truth. In Ephesians chapter 4, I have two points for us today. First point is what do we learn about the resurrection? What does the resurrection mean? Number one is Jesus the only good escape. Jesus, the only good escape. In Ephesians 4 and:e 17, it says, \"Therefore, I say this and testify in the Lord, you should no longer walk as Gentiles do in the futility of their thoughts. They are darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, and because of the hardness of their hearts. They became callous and gave themselves over to promiscuity for the practice of every kind of impurity with the desire for more and more. But what is but that is not how you came to know Christ assuming you heard about him uh and were taught by him as the truth is in Jesus to take off your former way of life the old self that is corrupted by deceitful desires to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and to put on the new self the one created according to God's likeness in righteousness and purity of the truth. See I love the beginning of this passage. It says that we are no longer like those who, you know, walk in darkness as Gentiles do, those who do not know God. And what separates us, it says, is the futility of their thoughts. What makes someone not a Christian is their thoughts. Is the thoughts of someone who is not a Christian that make them a non-Christian. You know, in today's day and age, many people talk about, you know, this this you new wave of Christianity of there's nothing that you can do. And to some sense, it's obviously true. We don't deserve anything. We don't deserve salvation. However, this concept is taken too far in the sense that there's physically nothing that you can do. And it removes loyal servitude to Christ. It it removes, you know, a dutybound love to the one that has spared us from suffering. And even if we expand in that thought of there's nothing that you can do in this passage, what separates those who live in the light and those who live in darkness is actually their thoughts. And that is a much harder wall to climb over than what you do. Imagine that. that the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian, a disciple and a non-disciple, someone in the light and not in the light, is not their actions, it's actually their thoughts. That is what separates light from darkness. And so you have to ask yourself, what do you think about? What are the things that you desire? Do you desire to uphold a high self-image of yourself? Do you desire uh a life where people can constantly reassure you of the image that you've set up? And so now you live a way into where people can just continue to compliment you and you seek attention and affirmation for something that you don't even believe is really true. You know, do you long to live a life here on earth where you're never wrong and everyone around you has to submit their thoughts and claims to you? And if it's wrong, then it's not just difference in opinion to you, but it's just wrong entirely cuz the world somehow revolves around you. And to be honest, I think you know, Nat can share this cuz sometimes I think like that sometimes like Moody, why are you so stubborn? You know, the rules revolve around you. I'm like, sorry, sorry. Um but uh I find that many of us can think this way you know and we have to make sure we don't bring these ideas these thoughts into our Christianity because they set us up against God against Jesus against his resurrection. And it is the thoughts in verse two that darken one's understanding and exclude them from the life of God. See, it is not that people don't understand Christianity. It is not that people don't understand God and he's incomprehensible. It's that they refuse to understand because they have thoughts and when given an ultimatum, they choose to abide by their own thoughts instead of what God wants to offer them. So for example right um many people do this we all do this you know in terms of sin and most often even persecution and it is a way that you know people cope for their wrong decisions. Sin and persecution is a way that people cope for their wrong decisions. Follow me with this. Right? And we understand this at a natural level. So my daughter Anna whenever she gets frustrated she does this thing. It's this catharsis and she goes like she goes like that, you know, whether like she has something dangerous and you take it away from her and she can't like lash out at you like or yell at you, you know, she just goes like this. And I don't really I don't really understand it, but that's what she does, right? Or if she's like trying to build something carefully like putting blocks together or stack something but you know her tiny little baby limbs can't like fully like you know comprehend like you know mind and hand connection and it falls apart. She and it she just goes like this. She just like she just flips out. It's the funniest thing and you know she she does it because either you're taking something that she cannot have or she's trying to do something that she's physically incapable of doing. And so what happens is her her mind is unable to think of a solution. I'm not, you know, of course she can't. She's a baby. Amen. But her mind's unable to think of a solution. So instead, she expresses how she's feeling inwardly. And it it ends up being this, right? Just flipping ass. Um, but what happens is, you know, we do this all the time. It's I want this, but I can't have it. So therefore, I do this. some some sort of coping solution, right? Or I want to do this, but I believe I am physically incapable of doing something. So therefore, instead of finding a solution, I just have this catharsis and outlet of what I'm feeling inwardly. See, every single one of us at a deep inner level wants God. However, we have thoughts that are conflicting against him and his way of life. So what do we do in this conflict and we're unable to find a solution? We sin. See, sin is the coping mechanism for an internal conflict. We've set oursel up against God. And the solution and in trying to express ourselves into instead of actually doing what he says, we sin. Sin is the solution of finding something other than God because of our internal conflicts. It's an escape. It's a fortress. It's a stronghold. It gives you comfort for having a callous heart. See, just like Anna, who is incapable of finding a solution, she has this outward expression. That is us in our sin. We have a callous heart. We don't turn to God's solution. And therefore, we have this outward catharsis of sin. But in verse 20, it says, \"But that is not how you came to know Christ. Meaning that you saw this struggle within yourself, constantly turning to sin, running to something that has no answer, no solution. It it only makes you end up, you know, repeating the cycle. And you saw that you saw that you were imprisoned by this sin and you ran away from it instead of running to it. See, you are saved in the light, walking according to his word, living in truth and purified because you chose to run away from the prison disguised as a fortress, disguised as a stronghold. And instead of doing things and running to something that you feel like might give you meaning, you realize that there's nothing there. And that is how you came to know Christ. See, you've seen the life that a darkened mind and a callous heart could lead to, and you chose to have nothing to do with it. You heard of the truth that is in Jesus. It says in verse 22 that you took off your form of way of life, which is, as we're talking, leaving that dark stronghold, leaving that prison disguised as a fortress, that sin of the acts that we commit because we choose not to follow what the Bible says. And in verse 23, you're renewed by the spirit of your mind and you put on the new self, one created in the image of God's likeness. And in verse 24, that is pure, that is righteous, and that is full of truth. And so today, why are we gathered here learning about the resurrection is because Jesus is the only good escape. That instead of running to sin, instead of running to things that have no meaning and finding outward expressions to what we're really feeling on the inside, think of it. That's why people lust. It's because they want love. People want ambition and but instead they turn it and God wants to lift them up, but they make it selfish and it becomes selfish ambition. You know, people want to be kind to others, but sometimes what happens is they may they become prideful and they do it for their own self-image. There is something that we're all seeking and because we don't turn to God, it turns into sin. Jesus is the only good escape. The only way to find fulfillment for that desire is through his resurrection. Is through what he has to offer. And so, if you're a baptized disciple, I want to ask you, get in the word of God. really see how you can be renewed in your minds and to be renewed constantly. And if you're learning how to become a Christian and you want to become a stronger Christian, you know, really see what thoughts do you have that contradict God's way of life. What thoughts do you have that set yourself up against God? What fortress are you escaping to? Is it God or is it sin? Let's go to point number two. God, the only eternal pleasure. Let's go to John 14. We're going to do a little Bible study. I got a few more scriptures in this point. In John 14 in verse 27, Jesus says, \"Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Don't let your heart be troubled or fearful. You have heard me tell you, I am going away. Excuse me. And I am coming to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father because the Father is greater than I. I have told you now before it happens so that when it does happen, you may believe. I will not talk with you much longer because the ruler of the world is coming. He has no power over me. On the contrary, so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do as the Father commanded me. Get up. Let's leave this place. See, Jesus in this passage, he's talking about his suffering, his death, his resurrection, and then his ascension all in this single passage. But I want to hone in on this word in verse 27 says, \"Peace I leave with you.\" See, that that word peace in Greek is arene. And this is literally what it means. It is the specific peace of Christianity, the tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ. And so fearing nothing from God and content with its earthly lot of whatever sort that is. See what Jesus is trying to offer the disciples anyone who wants to live a life in him is a soul that is constantly at peace. A soul that is so at peace that even at the unknown of whatever God might challenge them with that they can fully endure no matter how bad it gets. even if they don't even know what's going to happen to them because they have a hope waiting for them and that they can endure absolutely anything. And he says that the world does not give as he gives. What is he saying is that the world does not give you a soul at peace. It gives you the opposite. It gives you a a troubled and a fearful heart. And um I find that anxiety is a hot topic in in today's day and age, anxiety, stress, being overwhelmed, being overconerned with things that are minimal and trivial in the long distance and constantly feeling under pressure. And I know many of us today can feel that way at times. Constantly in fear and having a heart that's troubled. you know, uh, even for me, especially when I was younger in middle school, I I constantly, you know, had an overconern with what people thought of me. And I would actually, you know, make up lies to make myself feel better in some sort of way. Some of them wasn't always to get people's assurance, but in some sense, like try to make me feel better about myself or at least try to be funny. When I was in uh middle school, my my my the school that I went to was predominantly Mexican, about 60 to 70% Mexican. And so I thought it'd be really funny if I just told people that I was part Mexican for whatever reason. I I have no idea. You know, when you're in middle school, like you look back at things you did and you're like, \"What the heck?\" Like were you thinking, right? Like to me it makes no sense. But I got a kick out of it. I was trying to see like how many people could I convince that I was Mexican and trying to see if it works. And it worked until I told them that I was kidding, until I was lying. And you know, cuz you look at my parents, you're like, \"Those can't be your parents.\" You know, I'm like, \"Yes, cuz I'm Mexican, you know.\" Um, but I would make up these lies and try to feel better about myself. U another thing that I would do is, you know, after I uh was a disciple for about a year, I I walked away from God. And what I did, I have this very distinct memory of when I came back to school the day after I decided to no longer be a disciple. And I cursed for the first time in about a year. And I don't remember anyone from my freshman year of high school except for one guy. His name was Nathan. And Nathan told me the day in the moment I curse. He said, \"I've never heard anyone my age tell me this.\" Says, \"Malik, I'm disappointed in you.\" And at that moment I realized, oh wow, he noticed. Like he knew like I never did that before. And what he what he said was, you know, I really respected you for not doing what other people around you are doing. And it's really sad that you made this decision. And I I'm like 14, you know. I'm like, what? Disappointed me, you know? But I actually was really cut by that. I was really impacted by that. to to this day he's the only person from high school in my freshman year that I remember his name and you know someone in the kids kingdom service said it's like yo that was like Nathan the prophet you know to to David I was like I didn't even think about that um but in that moment I realized like wow am I really making this decision you know to feel actually feel better about myself am I just making this decision to get reassurance and do what other people around me are doing because it's easy because it's comfortable And it really challenged that thought. And so my freshman year, I lived in California. But my sophomore year, I moved to New York. And I told myself that I don't want to tell any more lies. I'm done with telling lies. I'm done with trying to pretend to be someone that I'm not. Uh I'm done with trying to, you know, gain people's approval. And so what I did is I I did my best to not care, to not care what other people thought about me. But because my solution wasn't godly and I didn't turn to God, my not caring turned into apathy. and my apathy turned into hatred. And that that hatred towards people who just like me previously I thought cared too much. A hatred toward people that I viewed were trying to get the reassurance of other people. And you know to me that I learned a very uh valuable lesson in this was that I wanted peace but instead because I didn't turn to God I became pessimistic and I took not caring to an extreme level. And this was the order. I fell away. I had a callous heart. I didn't want to be a liar. Amen. But I also didn't want to be a disciple. And so because of that, it produced the sin of apathy. It it produced lack of compassion, not caring for other people. And then it also produced hatred. And as you see in verse 27, it caused me to have a troubled heart. And that's what happens when you turn to anything that isn't God. Turn to anything that isn't Jesus. You're looking for some semblance of peace, some sort of solution. But because of not, it's not God, all it does is produce sin in your life. But Jesus wants to give you what this world cannot offer you. And that is actual peace. that is a genuine relationship with him that can actually produce something that the world cannot give you. And in verse 28, he speaks of his resurrection. But then in verse 30, he says something interesting. He said, \"The ruler of this world is coming.\" And you would think like, \"Well, isn't that you, Jesus? Aren't you the ruler of this world? Is God not the ruler of this world?\" Well, you know, a little Bible study here. Write down these passages. 1 Corinthians 4:4, you know, a bunch of these passages will talk about who this ruler is. Matthew 4:9, John 12:31, Ephesians 2:2, and 1 John 5:19. What do we learn in all these passages? That the ruler of this world is Satan. And you can do a study yourself. The ruler of this world is Satan. Why? Because he has captured the hearts and minds of everyone who refuses to believe in God. And it's literally one or the other. There is no middle grounds. It is either your mind is ruled by God or it is ruled by Satan. Let's go to Acts chapter 2. I came in here like a deranged maniac with my hair big all the time. Thanks for being patient till I got a haircut. Acts chapter 2 and verse 22. It says, \"Fellow Israelites, listen to these words. This Jesus of Nazareth was a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs that God did among you. through him. Just as you yourselves know, though he was delivered up according to God's determined plan and fornowledge, you used lawless people to nail him to a cross and kill him. God raised him up, ending the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be held by death. So what we learn in this passage, as many of us have read many times before, is that Jesus, though he died, he couldn't be held by the pains of death. And that as we read in the previous passage where it literally says that the ruler of this world is coming but he does not rule over Jesus. He has no power over Jesus. We learn in this passage that death doesn't rule over Jesus. So we kind of get this equation that death equals Satan. This concept that the one trying to hold you down, the one trying to bring you down under, make you feel under pressure, make you feel pain constantly and learn nothing from it, that is from Satan. and that Jesus overpowered it, that it couldn't hold him down. Let's go to First Peter 3. We're going to see what this means. Hope you guys are following me. I actually do very well. Like, so not just like if I hear good things, can I Okay, wow. Like they're responding. It's going well. But sometimes I say things I'm not sure if it makes sense. So I'll look at, you know, Natalie because I actually I always ask her if my lessons make sense. So during the lesson, if I look at her and she does this, I'm like, okay, I'm going to expand on that thought real quick. So So not just like do does good, you know, volume help me, but even if you go like that, that'll also that'll also help me. Amen. Then then I'll know that what I'm saying doesn't make sense. In in 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 13 it says, \"Who then will harm you if you are devoted to what is good? But even if you should suffer for righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear them or be intimidated? But in your hearts regard Christ the Lord as holy, ready at any time to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason, for the hope that is in you. Yet do this with gentleness and reverence, keeping a clear conscience, so that when you are accused, those who disparge your good conduct in Christ will be put to shame. For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil. For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the spirit. in which he also went and made proclamation to the spirits in prison who in the past were disobedient when God patiently waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared in it a few that is eight people were saved through water. Baptism which corresponds to this now saves you not as a removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward Christ towards God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. We're going to break this down. You learn three things in everything that we just read read in verse 13 to 17. It talks about enduring suffering because you obey and enact the will of God. And that you can endure suffering because this kind of suffering will refine you to be more like Christ. Unlike the suffering that the world offers you that literally leads you to nothing and having a constant cycle. And it says in verse 18 to 20 exactly why you can endure this kind of suffering. How can you endure this kind of suffering? Because it says that Christ did it just the same. That he endured physical suffering on the cross. And we actually learn that it wasn't just on earth that he endured physical suffering. That he literally went into hell and he preached the gospel to them. And you might ask like why did he do that? Like what did he say? You know, why did he why it talk about those in the days of Noah that disobedience? Well, it's not it's less about what he said, but the fact that he did it. That Jesus when he took on our sins, died the death of a sinner and went physically, you know, and spiritually into hell when he died and then preached to them. All so that we can know while we're here on earth, when we're enduring suffering and we're trying to make disciples, we're trying to save souls, Jesus did the exact same thing, enduring the same kind of suffering, trying to preach the word to them. Amen. And you know when Jesus died you know he was showing us that it is totally possible that we can endure that same kind of suffering. So how can we endure persecution, suffering and hardships is because Jesus did the same exact thing while also trying to save souls. He showed you that you can do just as he did because he did it literally in hell. Isn't that incredible? And the third thing we learn here is that water is and the pledge of a good conscience towards God. And once again, that good conscience, the thoughts and desires that we talked about earlier, you're pledging your mind to Christ through the resurrection, it saves you. Isn't that amazing? like because Jesus endured such suffering for the sake of his life and forgiveness of sins that we can do the same exact thing for those around us when we pledge our minds to him, our thoughts and our desires to him. Let's go to Romans chapter 6. In Romans 6, it says in verse one, what should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? Absolutely not. How can we who died to sin still live in it? Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore, we were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father, so we too may walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in the likeness of death of his death, we will certainly also be uh in the likeness of his resurrection. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so the body ruled by sin might be rendered powerless so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin since a person who has died is freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we also uh that we will also live with him because we know that Christ having been raised from the dead will not die again. Death no longer rules over him. Once again, Jesus has complete power over the one that trying to rule over him. And what it says here in this passage is that if you are baptized for the forgiveness of your sins and you are raised in the likeness of his resurrection that that same power that cannot hold Jesus down also cannot hold you down and that that that same power has no power over you that it cannot rule you. So when Jesus says I have come to give you peace and that that the ruler of this world is coming and has no power over him. If you have been raised in his resurrection that same power has no power over you. That is why we must always focus on his resurrection. And it says here that literally that when we participate in we will be raised in the newness of his life. Once again not because of our actions but because of our thoughts. The way we are at at an inner an inner level is fundamentally difference. See, you've been renewed. You've been pledged to have a clear conscience towards God. No longer escaping to a dark fortress, but instead of you're escaping to him, but because of that, we must constantly renew ourselves. That just because it's happened to you once, it doesn't mean that you can no longer do it again. And in 2 Corinthians 4, it literally says, \"Therefore, we do not lose hearts, though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.\" It is a constant renewal, uh a constant refreshing of the minds, a constantly being more like Christ every single day. Philippians 1, it says, uh I am I am uh you know, sometimes you can't read your own handwriting. All right, I see. I am sure of this that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ. So Jesus started a good work in you, but it is incomplete. You must let it be complete every single day, striving to be more like Jesus. And lastly, one of my favorites in second Peter 1, it talks about adding to your faith all these qualities that you gain from his word. And it says that for if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being useless and unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. The person who lacks these things is blind and shortsighted and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins. You know, we hear some stuff like that and that wow, like being useless, being unfruitful, forgetting your cleansing. And it sounds terrible sometimes, but the reality is it's not that God is like holding like a spear waiting for you to fall and then just plunges it into you, but he's expressing the harsh reality of the life without God. He He's not waiting to punish you the moment you mess up. He He's trying to tell you what happens when you're not with him. The reality of life without God. And what it is is less of a a punishment, him waiting for us to fall, but it is actually the completion of our own personal desires. It is the end of our own decision-m when we choose to live life without God. But through Christ's resurrection, you get a chance, as Chris was saying, you get a chance to no longer live in this harsh reality made up by the consequences of your own desires. that you get a chance to stop escaping to these strongholds that mean absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things. And if only all it does is harden your heart, make your heart more callous, and make you want to still commit acts that you realize that you have some sort of cognitive dissonance going on, but it's okay because you feel comfortable. You get a chance to endure suffering that'll actually refine you because you live out God's will and that you no longer want a heart that is troubled or afraid. See, through Christ's resurrection, God can and will be your eternal pleasure. Let's close out in Psalm chapter 16. I love this psalm. It talks not just about uh Jesus as many of the psalms do, but it even talks about us. In Psalm 16 and verse one, it says, \"Protect me, God, for I take refuge in you. I said to the Lord, you are my Lord. I have nothing good besides you. As for the holy people who are in the land, they are noble ones. All my delight is in them. The sorrows of those who take another god for themselves will multiply. I will not pour out their drink offering offerings of blood and will not speak their names with my lips. Lord, you are my portion and my cup of blessing. You hold my future. The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places indeed. I have a beautiful inheritance. I will bless the Lord who counsels me. Even at night when my thoughts trouble me, I will always let the Lord guide me because he is at my right hand. I will not be shaken. Therefore, my heart is glad and my whole being rejoices. My body also rests securely for you will not abandon me to shol. You will not allow your faithful one to see decay. You reveal the path of life to me. In your presence is abundant joy. At your right hand are eternal pleasures. See, I love this passage because it talks about this decay that we do not have to see, that we do not have to let happen. And it's not just talking about a physical body decay when you die, but it's talking about literally here on earth. your life, your soul does not have to be decaying every single day, but you can be renewed every single day. And that it is through his resurrection that you get a chance. And it says here that we should take refuge in God. that we should let him counsel us every single day and every single night, letting him guide you always since he reveals the path of life that he is abundant joy and at his right hand are eternal pleasures. So let's always remember that God is our eternal pleasure and that Jesus is our only good escape. Happy Easter morning and to God be all the glory.",

It made me want to do a specific kind of lesson that I feel like is very appropriate for this kind of setting. And my title uh for you guys today is be in awe of him. Be in awe of him. Like just just look at everything. Look at the the the massive blue sky and the fact that the sky isn't technically blue. Like it's just the chemicals that happens when it comes down and the reflection in our eyes now it appears blue but in reality the sky has no physical color. It's not a physical object yet it's blue. And then think of the stars that are in the sky once the sun goes down. the the the stars that we we still are spending lifetimes trying to understand us, trying to understand the the way they the way they uh operate in terms of the massive amount of the universe. But then even when you bring it down here to earth, you know, scientists say that we know more about space than we do about our own ocean. And the depths of the ocean are so difficult to explore because of once you get down to a certain depth that pressure is we we don't have technology able to with withstand that kind of pressure and like literally our own ocean on our own planet. We still have yet to fully understand um you know being in awe of God. Let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 3. I think that being in awe of God is very important, but you know, sometimes it can be quite difficult to understand how to do that. Ecclesiast chapter 3, it says in verse 10, I have seen the task that God has given the children of Adam to keep them occupied. He has made everything appropriate in his time. He has also put eternity in their hearts. But no one can discover the work of the work God has done from beginning to end. I know that there is nothing better uh for them than to rejoice and enjoy the good life. It is also the gift of God whenever anyone eats, drinks, and enjoys all his efforts. I know that everything God does will last forever. There is no adding to it or taking away from it. God works so that people will be in awe of him. Wow. Isn't that an amazing scripture? Yeah. Like it literally says that no one knows what God has done from beginning to end. Like we don't know the beginning of how God created life. Many people speculate. Everything is still theory. And yet we are still spending our entire lives understand the purpose of it. Why has God created all that he has done? You know you people try to understand you know uh earthquakes. Why? Why? Why are there such the these violent things that happen in the earth? And it devastates people. And then people go like, well, why would God create that? Why would God create such uh acts of nature that can destroy livelihoods, things like hurricanes, things like famines? And it says in this passage, it's so that we can be in awe of him. Wow. Cuz when you look at those things, all that you are reminded of is how small you are. Wow. Never mind. All you're reminded of is how little control you really have. We spend so much time trying to control our life, trying to control what happens, our outcomes, and even like people try to find like what is my individual purpose? What is meant for me? But God is trying to help remind you how how small we are. So we understand who's really in control. Amen. You know, eternity is in the heart because the reality is we all want to know. Everyone to some degree wants to know the one question. Why? Yeah. Why was it created? Where where is it going? What is its purpose? What is my purpose? God has put that in our hearts. And I love it because at the very end he at the the end of it is God wants us to be in awe of his works. So almost like that question why should lead you to God and looking at what he has created. You know, it it's so easy going back to the idea of like why me? What what is my purpose? But God is trying to get you to not look at yourself, but to look at him to to look at what he has created. Amen. And I find when you're able to do that, it's like life seems so simple to go through. Yes, you might have challenges. Yes, you might be suffering. You have hardships, financial struggles, maybe family trauma, or maybe you're dealing with temptation. But once you realize that you can have all of God and what he's created for you and around you, it's like, you know what? I can actually go through it. It doesn't change my situation. It doesn't give me an answer what to do sometimes, but I know that I can go through it because I am in awe of God. Let's go to Psalm chapter 73. All right. And this awe of God is so important because I find that people really fall people really falter when they don't fear God. When you're not in awe of God, you know, or or sometimes even us when we forget to fear God, we forget to be in awe of God. And this kind of fear, this kind of awe, it it puts you at a standstill. It puts you at a point like you know you know those movies when you see uh the giant avalanche coming and everyone stands still and you're sitting there like what are you doing like start running but the reality is like you're in awe. You're like it's fearful but you're like what is happening right now you know like yes you could run for your life yes you could make it but what you're seeing is so unfathomable to you right now. And so the reality is in those movies if we were in those same situations we might stand still as well. you know, you see the tsunami coming or you see those videos of people like this massive tidal wave comes in and they're just standing there and we're thinking, why aren't you running? But in that situation, you do the same thing. Yeah. That's what awe is like. You're just confused, but you're also like amazed by what's happening. And Psalm chapter 73. I I read this in my quiet time a few days ago and it really inspired me. Sometimes you got to preach your quiet time. Amen. That's right. In Psalm 73 in verse one, it says, \"God is indeed good to Israel, to the pure in heart.\" So, I love this psalm because the the the author starts with a fact that God is indeed good to his people, to the pure in hearts. But here what he says later says, \"But as for me, my feet almost slipped.\" Uh he says, \"My steps my steps nearly went astray for I envied the arrogance. I saw the prosperity of the wicked. They have an easy time until they die and their bodies are wellfed. They are not in trouble like others. They are not afflicted like most people. Therefore, pride is their necklace and violence covers them like a garments. So the the author starts with this fact and I find that we live lives very similar to this. Like I know God is good. I know God is good to me but why do I still envy people who don't know God? Yeah. Uh-huh. Why do I still want what people have when I know that they don't have God? And as author, I find can very much uh relate to us, you know, and it's really sad because when you don't fear God, it's literally because you ignore his works. Come on. You see all that he has done and you don't come to the conclusion that you're small. In fact, you try to find ways to be better than it. Try to find ways to overcome it. You know, I think it's amazing. God has given us uh science to understand the world that he created. But I think you know people use them as tools to try to to you know disfigure God, find a way to dismantle him. But no, God put science so we could understand it with oh my goodness we are in zero control. You look at gravity and you can understand gravity but we are not in control of gravity. Right? You know the the the heat wave whenever you know the Tampa heat comes in we can measure it. We can look at it. We can go out and we can sunbathe in it. But you know, we can't control that. You know, it's supposed to put us in awe of him. Point number one, just like it says in this passage, envy stops off. Wow. Envy stops off. Because what happens is, you know, when you lose focus of his works, what you do is envy. You're looking at other people's works. What are other people doing around you? whether it be, you know, their lives, you know, I I can very much relate to this. I don't know if you guys have ever, you know, you're scrolling on Instagram and you see, you know, someone has a nice walk in nature and you sometimes you think, I wonder if I wonder if my problems would go away if I lived in a place like that. You know what I mean? Or or maybe it's, you know, you see these homes with these great big houses with nice decor. You're like, I wonder if I would feel less lonely if I had a house like that. if I have possessions like this. And what happens is now all of a sudden our awe and our peace is not focused on God. It is focused on people. It's focused on things. Envy stops awe. And if you keep reading, I love what the author says in verse 13. Did I purify my heart and wash my hands in innocence for nothing? For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning. If I had decided to say these things aloud, I would have betrayed your people. When I try to understand all this, it seemed hopeless until I entered God's sanctuary. Then I understood their destiny. You see, the the author is talking about this time when you're conflicted. You know, the Bible talks about this a lot being double-minded. Yeah. And it's like, well, I want you, God, but I envy them. They have something that I want. They have something that I have now convinced myself that I need in order to have a better life. But in in the author's search for trying to understand this, I love what he says. He says, \"I try to understand all this, but it seemed hopeless.\" See, often times when you're looking for an answer, looking for a solution, if you're focused on the solution rather than God, you will end up being hopeless. When you're looking for an answer to how come they have more, how come I don't have that? Why is it that I am with you but they have better things than I do? And oftentimes the answer to that question looking for that specific answer will end you up uh being home uh hopeless because there is no answer. And I love it because it says until I enter God's sanctuary because the solution isn't having those things. The solution is going to God. The solution to envy. The solution to when you're worried about your life, you look at all that's around you and you're confused. Why do people have better lives seemingly than you do? Even if they don't have God, the solution, how do you actually come to peace with that? Is it having those things? It isn't trying to find a way to to understand it as comprehensible. It's going to God. That is the solution. Um let's go to Hebrews chapter nine. All right. You know that this hopelessness, it comes from not getting what you want. But the answer is entering God's sanctuary. We'll look at some passages about what it means to enter God's sanctuary. And then we'll eat up some great food that Chris Jones is cooking. In Hebrews chapter 9, we're going to look at some uh two passages very briefly. Hebrews 9 vers 24. Let's talk about Jesus. It says, \"For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands, only a model of the true one, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God for us.\" Isn't that an amazing passage about entering the sanctuary? And it's the idea was back then the sanctuary was the temple. Yeah, but now it's saying Jesus has entered that sanctuary for us, but not a physical temple where you can now go to him and you can see him sitting there and you know he enacts his judgments but in heaven and that he's there for us like the idea is that Jesus is there advocating for us before God saying look at my son look at my daughter and you know the sanctuary is it's important to realize that right now for us today in this day and age. It is symbolic of heaven. Right? Let's go to Hebrews chapter 10. It says in verse 19, \"Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus, remember the sanctuary is heaven. But now through the blood of Jesus, we can enter it and we can enter it boldly.\" It says in verse 20, he has inaugurated for us a new and living way through the curtain that is through his flesh. So two things are mentioned here for entering that sanctuary. It says by his blood and through his flesh. What does that remind you of? Communion. And it's this idea of you know reflecting on what Jesus has done for you. remembering what he has done but also having self assessment assessments to realize can I really enter there boldly not arrogantly I think many people they they they hope that God will accept them without having to change anything about them that is entering arrogantly that is entering ignorantly but entering boldly because you're entering with confidence because you know that you're doing everything you can to be with God in heaven and so this concept cept of when you're struggling with envy, when you're struggling with looking at people and looking at things other than looking at God, how do you enter a sanctuary? Well, of course, the answer is being focused in heaven. And that kind of reminds me of the scripture. Go to Colossians chapter 3. How can we enter the sanctuary right now if we're still alive? Amen. I'm sure that might be a question maybe some of you guys are asking. Colossians chapter 3, well, the answer is right here. It says in verse one, \"So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.\" So, how can we be focused on entering the sanctuary while we're still walking, while we're still breathing here on earth, living as disciples, is you have to set your mind on things above, right? It's it's literally in in a way that even though you're living here on earth, you're not focused on what's here on earth. You're focused on what's waiting for you with God. And what's amazing is that when you focus on those things, you know, you could have, you know, 10 years, 20, 50, you know, 60 more years of life, but you can easily go through it because it's not about what's around you. It's about what God is going to give you about the life that he has waiting for you. And I love it because, you know, the the saying goes, you know, get your head out of the clouds. Yeah. Well, this is the opposite. Say, get your head in the clouds, dude. Do do the quite opposite. Like now, don't don't be focused on what's here. Be focused on what's ahead of you. Yeah. And so it's easy to go through what you're going through currently. So if you're, you know, struggling with envy today, if you're struggling with, you know, what's around you, what could you have that could better your life? Focus that there's only one thing that could better your life, and that is being with God in heaven. Let's close out in Philippians chapter 4. I want to do good on time. I think last time I uh we went a little long, so [Applause] going on. I like I like that you guys are laughing because you guys know, you know, you're like, \"Yeah, he did.\" You know, Philippians chapter 4, it says in verse four, \"Rejoice in the Lord always.\" Amen. I will say it again. Rejoice. Let your graciousness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Don't worry about anything, but in everything through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. I love this passage. You know, it's saying, you know, rejoice in the Lord always. It it's this, you know, obviously there's a time and place for everything. Time to mourn, time for sadness, time for joy, time to be glad. But this concept of rejoicing in the Lord is this way of it doesn't matter what time or season it is in your life, you can always be focused on God. No matter what is happening, even if it is time of morning, you can still be focused on what God has in front of you. And even when you continue reading, I love when it says uh it says, \"Let your graciousness be known to everyone. The Lord is near.\" You know, there's this concept of this idea of being awe of God, being a fear of God. The Lord is near. This concept of of urgency. You know, if the Lord is near, you're realizing, wait a minute, I got to get my act together right now. I gota I got to settle things right now. But what happens is when you lose that awe of God, when you lose that fear of the Lord, when you lose that urgency, you start to think like, well, maybe I could have these things. Maybe I I I could enact on my temptations for a little bit. It's okay. I I'll repent. Maybe I could have these things, have a better life, but, you know, I'll figure it out. I can still, you know, give into my envy, but somehow still turn to God. But the Bible says, \"No, the Lord is near.\" Carefully watch yourself. And that's what I love about communion. It talks about self-examination and you can't have proper proper self-examination without being urgent because if you're not urgent there there's no real desire to change immediately. A change will always be far off but the Bible says the Lord is near. Uh then when you keep reading of course my favorite part that the peace that transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds. And that goes back to this eternity that God put on the human hearts. We can't fully understand this. The idea of eternity while we're still here on earth, you know, I love this passage because that it's that peace when you're able to focus on God. Let go of what you see in front of you. And that peace by being focused on God is people can't fully fathom that. No one understands why are you so joyful as a disciple. No one understands. Why do you keep on singing? Why are you singing in the middle of this park? You know, don't you find that kind of embarrassing? Well, of course not. I have this peace that guards my heart. It transcends all understanding. And it might seem confusing. You may not understand it, but if you could only experience that with me, then maybe one day you'll get it. Amen. And that's so what that's uh what's so amazing about being a disciple. Really all it is is you have this peace that is is is almost difficult to really comprehend but you want other people to share in that as well because there is nothing and there is absolutely nothing like that peace and so let us have that that peace that transcends all understanding because of our awe of God. Let let us not focus on what's in front of us. You know let us not give into envy. Let's not give into temptation because life is not simply what's what we can see but what God has waiting in store for us. And so let's be in a God. Let's fear God. Let's have that urgency. Amen. You know, and I believe that if we can do that, then every time you're confused, you can easily have those questions sorted. Every time you don't know what you're doing, every time you're confused on why don't why doesn't someone believe this? How could I really help somebody? is going to God in his sanctuary, being focused on God with your mind and with your hearts. And I believe that, you know, if we can do this, that that peace that we can have that it can literally be overflowing. I it can be something that is so strong is so desirable to have and that we just want simply more of that when you talk and when you fellowship with other disciples, you want more of that. When you read your Bible, you're having your quiet time, you want more of that. Nothing seems like task. Nothing seems like I have to. But you're trying to have this peace that transcends all understanding. So let's be an off of God and let's not have envy that blocks us from being an off God. That's got",

    "transcript": "Previously, when Joshua had sent the people away, the Israelites had gone to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance. The people worshiped the Lord throughout Joshua's lifetime. And during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived Joshua, they had seen all the Lord's great works he had done uh for Israel. So what we see here is that when Joshua took them into the promised land that after a certain point he died and they he had contemporaries who lived with him and sadly after a certain point they died. And let's see in verse 8 Joshua said of none the servant of the Lord died at the age of 110. They buried him in the territory of his inheritance in the Timnath Hares in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gash. The whole generation was also gathered to their ancestors. After them, another generation who rose up who did not know the Lord or the works he had done for Israel. So what do we learn of what happens when Joshua and all his contemporaries died? All the people turned to wickedness. They all turned to sin. And it it's really quite sad because literally Israel was faithful until Joshua and his fellow contemporaries died. And they fall into this wicked wicked sin with prostitution to other gods. It says in verse 11, the Israelites did what was evil in the Lord's sights. They worshiped the bales and abandoned the Lord their God uh of their ancestors who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed other gods from the surrounding peoples and bowed down to them. They angered the Lord for they abandoned him and worshiped Baal and the Asherites. The Lord's anger burned against Israel and he handed them over to marauders or raiders who raided them. He sold them to to the enemies around them and they could no longer resist their enemies. Whenever the Israelites went out, the Lord was against them and brought disaster on them just as he had promised and sworn to them. So they suffered greatly. So this is what happened. It was a very sad sad cycle. You would see, you know, Joshua after he dies, they turn to sin. And of course with any of us when we're lost, we're stuck, we're repeating sin, and then it just feels like everyone's against us, nothing is working, life is terrible, we feel it, and we cry out to God. We're frustrated. But God, he allows it to happen. God didn't do this because he hated them. He did this because he loved them. The the distress was important for them to realize that they needed God. That until they're crying out to him could be genuine. And so sometimes even for us when you're in distress, it's yes, God might be against you. It's not because he hates you, but he wants you to come out of this through your distress. He wants you to realize that you need him because you're setting yourself up against God. But there's an important purpose to this distress. Um it says in verse 16, the Lord raised up judges who saved them from the power of the marauders, but they did not listen to their judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods, bowing down to them. They quickly turned away uh of their ancestors who had walked in disobedience to the Lord's commands. They did not do as their ancestors did. Whenever the Lord raised up a judge for Israelites, for the Israelites, the Lord was with them um and saved the people from the power of the enemies while the judge was still alive. The Lord was moved to pity whenever they groaned because of those who were oppressing and afflicting them. Whenever the judge died, the Israelites would act even more corruptly than their ancestors, following other gods to serve them and bow and worship to them. They did not turn from their evil practices or their obstinate ways. So this was what would happen time and time and time again. They would have a judge, a leader, and the Hebrew word it literally means a savior, someone to help get them out of the affliction and oppression of the neighboring nations. That they it was happening because of their sin. God allowed the oppression because of their sin. And because of that, they felt this great distress. They'd be frustrated. They'd feel stuck. And God would say, \"You know what? I can't ignore that. I can't ignore your crime.\" So, he raises up a judge to save them. And they actually listen to the judge. But once the judge dies, they go right back. They repeat the cycle over and over again. And the book of Judges is filled with men and women who God has raised up to lead them out of this oppression. You know, you have men like Gideon. You had men, you know, uh men like, uh Samson, even though, you know, he had some twisted things going on there, he he was a judge, you know, yet you have Ehood. You have a incredible woman like Deborah, right? All these people, these heroes, but yet they were never able to break the cycle. Uh my title for you guys is breaking the cycle. Let's finish out in Judges here before we go to 1 Samuel. Let's go to Judges uh chapter uh 21. It says in verse 25, in those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did whatever seemed right to him. See this is what happens. It's actually a double meaning. So this is of course before they established kings like Saul, David and Solomon and so they had no physical king but also the other meaning is that they rejected God as their king and so therefore they did whatever seemed right to them uh older people and so before you know going into the book of Samuel you have that important book uh the book of Ruth right and the book of Ruth is incredible and it's not just something that's preached among women you know during women's days are only midweeks. But you know, everyone needs the book of Ruth. It's an incredible important uh part of the story of God with his people. And Ruth, you know, who knows where Ruth is from? Is Ruth an Israelite? It's a Moabit, right? And it's kind of very symbolic of what was really happening of God actually using any and different instances happening for his greater purpose. Right? So Ruth was a Moabitete and she married the man named Boaz. Do you know who Boaz was? The son of Rahab. And Rahab was one of the prostitutes who actually saved the spies of Israel, right? So you literally have these people who like like the the son of a prostitute. You have a Moabitete. And yet God is using them. God is using them for his greater purpose. And we would actually learn that Boaz and Ruth become the greatgrparents of David. They're the men that we look up to. And so, let's go to 1st Samuel chapter 1. 1st Samuel chapter 1. In verse one, it says, \"Uh, there is a man from Brethium, uh, Zoim in the hill country of Ephraim. His name was Elcana, son of Jerome, son of Elu, son of Toh, son of Ze and Ephroite. He had two wives. The first named Hannah, the second named Penna. Penna had children, but Hannah was childless. Point number one, the definition of distress. The definition of distress. And right off the bat in 1st Samuel 1 verse one, it starts off with immediate issues. It talks about this man who is the leader of his family and it's not a couple. It's a it's a thrpple. you know, he has he has two wives. And anytime you see a man with multiple wives in the Bible, there's different issues in his life. And in this specific instance, you know, you have one of his wives who have children and one who does not. And I love how the book of Samuel starts because it's really honing in on one family and how literally it's going to start from one family and God's plan for all the nations. Even though he looks at everyone as a collective, he always hones in on the individual. And so, you know, uh God sees this polygamous relationship and he allows it. And this is a great message for us because just because he allows something, it doesn't mean he supports it. And so for us, like you might be in sin or you've done some wicked things and just because God didn't destroy you, it doesn't mean that he supports your decisions. And we learned that right here. And you can literally force something to happen so badly because you want it. But it does not mean that God is with you only because you haven't faced severe consequences. Yes. And let's pick it up in verse three. It says, \"This man would go from his town every year to worship and sacrifice uh to the Lord of armies at Shiloh, where Eli's two sons, Hoffne and Phineas, were the Lord's priests.\" Okay, so now we're learning who was the judge at this time before the kings, right? Eli and his sons that he appointed as priests. And they're at Shiloh. Why is that important? Because Shiloh is where the tabernacle is. We all know about the great temple that Solomon built. But before the temple, there was a big tent, a very luxurious tent. And it was here at Shiloh where Joshua left it. And in verse four it says, \"Whenever Elana offered a sacrifice, he always gave portions of meat to his wife Pena and to each of her sons and daughters, but he gave a double portion to Hannah, for he loved her.\" Though the Lord had kept her from conceiving, her rival would taunt her severely just to provoke her. Because the Lord had kept Hannah from conceiving year after year, when she went up to the Lord's house, her rival taunted her. In this way, Hannah would weep and would not eat. Hannah, why are you crying? Her husband, Okana, would ask. Why won't you eat? Why are you troubled? Am I not better to you than 10 sons? So, in this situation, Hannah, who we're going to follow here for a a moment, is in great distress. And why? Because she wanted to be a mom. And yet, her her womb was closed. and her rival, you know, her her sister wife. If you watch any of those Netflix documentaries, her but it doesn't describe her as like her companion, her rival, her enemy, like the person who, you know, seemingly you you should find a way to get along with was her rival and wanted her downfall. But even though she was mocked by her, it was God who closed the book. God was the reason behind this. And so her distress, her suffering, not all distress and suffering is a punishment for your sins. And if anything, God's actually just trying to get you to a spot to realize more that he needs you for a greater plan, for a greater purpose, but he has to drive you to that spot to realize that you're needed for a greater purpose more than yourself. And so God not only applied distress for all of his people but even to the individual for every individual case. Like literally this is a window to see that yes there is distress for all of Israel but for every individual family there was a personal distress applied but this temporary hardship and distress it was required for God's plan for Hannah. It was needed. And you know we can actually learn a few things also from this instance. Um uh you know for us married men single men take notes of what exactly not to do in a marriage. See this is what Elana does. Aana does everything wrong. So notice how you know they go and they go to the the the tabernacle and okay well let's give our food portions. You know you know pen you know here your portions. It's what you need. But hey, I'm gonna give you double. And I imagine this rivalry rivalry wasn't for no reason. It was literally because of the husbands. The the husband literally had favorites and gave the one Hannah double portion because he loved her. And it's kind of like, you know, Elana might have viewed like, oh yeah, Peda, she's the one that gives me children, but I love Hannah. That's the one for me. And so literally the story starts off with a wicked man if you really think about it. Someone who is not doing and walking according to what God wanted. And so here's what the first thing he did wrong is he he created competition between his wives. And what happens is is obviously we thankfully uh we all are in one marriage, right? So it's not that there's competition between your wives, but maybe as a husband your wife is competing for something else in your life. Maybe she's competing for attention maybe when you come home and you're tired from work. Maybe your wife is competing for attention from entertainment, from media. Maybe it's from hanging out with the voice. Whatever it is, but but competing for attention. And what it does, it produces insecurity. I'm sharing this from my own personal weaknesses at times. Amen. Um, but we have to learn to not let our wives compete for our attention. Amen. The second thing he does which another way I've learned had to learn a lot about this guys was he makes his wife uh not makes his wife but he fails to meet his wife's emotional need. So what happens is she's crying. She can't bear children and her her other sister wife is literally taunting her. And here he comes up sees her crying weeping in great distress and he says am I not good enough for you? Like come on. Like look at this. Am I not better than having all these children? And they literally fail to meet the emotional need in the time. And you know we you know as husbands might do this for our wives or wives to their husbands but really we can all relate because we can all do this to any relationship. We take someone's personal hardship that they're going through personally. You know, think of sometimes maybe maybe some of us had had um you know, maybe a mother. Maybe you come home from school and you know, maybe you're bullied, maybe you were tormented, maybe you're picked apart, you come home and you're sad and your mom's like, \"Am I not a good mother for you and all of a sudden it's like she takes it personally, but it was never her to begin with.\" You know, maybe even as disciples, you're in a Bible study, you're fired up, you're doing your best, the person's like, \"I just I don't think that's true. I don't think I I don't really agree with that. I don't really want to do that. I don't want to become a disciple anymore. In fact, I don't like what you guys are teaching. You guys are crazy. You're a cult. I'm I'm a separate. But then we say, \"Oh, maybe I'm not a good teacher. Maybe I'm not a good disciple. Maybe I can't really teach anybody. Maybe I shouldn't desire leadership. Maybe I shouldn't help anybody. Maybe this doesn't even work. Maybe God's not even real.\" Now, you're thinking all these different things which are totally untrue because you're taking it personally. And it's not your fault to begin with. It is their fault. Right? And so we have to learn from this. And I think sometimes we might even attempt to do this with God. You know what we we think that you know with taking other people's hardships personally, we try to gaslight them, manipulate them, and somehow try to play the victim. But God doesn't play those games. God is like, \"No, no, no. You're you're not the victim. You're at fault.\" Like, \"Stop trying to think that all these bad things are happening to you. You're the one doing these bad things.\" And so we have to make sure that we don't play these games with God either. Um let's go to let's keep reading in verse 9. It says on one occasion Hannah got up after they ate and drank at Shiloh. The priest Eli was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the Lord's temple. Uh deeply hurt, Hannah praised to the Lord and wept with many tears. Making a vow, she pleaded, \"Lord of armies, if you will take notice of your servant's affliction, remember and not forget me, and give your servant a son, I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and his hair will never be cut.\" So in Hannah's deep anguish, deep distress, she prays. She goes to God and she prays. And you know, we learn obviously that Eli was the serving priest at the time. And keep this in mind as we read the next part. Eli uh his he was losing his eyesight. He we learn later that he was overweight and the people don't respect him. So think of this situation as he's about to approach Hannah. Let's read. It says in verse 12, \"While she continued praying in the Lord's presence, Eli watched her mouth. Hannah was praying silently and thought and though her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard. Eli thought she was drunk and said to her, \"How long are you going to be drunk? Get rid of your wine.\" \"No, my lord,\" Hannah replied. \"I am a woman with broken hearts.\" \"I haven't had wine or beer. I've been pouring out my heart before the Lord. Don't think of me as a wicked woman. I've been praying from the depth of my anguish and resentment.\" Eli responded, \"Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the requests you made of him. May your servant find favor with you? She replied. Then Hannah went on her way, she ate and no longer looked despondent. The next morning, Elana and Hannah got up early early to worship before the Lord. After afterward, they returned to uh Rama. Then Elana was intimate with his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her. After some time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel because she said, \"I requested him from the Lord.\" And so, she's crying in anguish. And this man, unrespected, kind of blind, you know, a little overweight, sees her and she's praying. And the instance she kind of sees from this a little bit is that maybe either one, he isn't in the temple very often to see people praying, or two, people don't come very often to the tabernacle to pray in the first place. So, he automatically just assumes that she's drunk. And and I think even more so, even three, is that his own laziness, his own wickedness that we'll see later in his relationship with his sons. I'm sure he kind of projected his own self-indulgence onto this woman trying to pour out her hearts, which sometimes that we see. You know, sometimes maybe we were going through a bad day and maybe take it out on the wrong person, you know, take it on the person that's trying to give their hearts to us, but we can't do as he did and self-project onto other people because of our own personal issues. And but this is the same pattern that you see at an individual level. God's people right now, Hannah was in distress. And so she cries out to God. And God allows this great distress because he loves them. God allowed this great distress for Hannah because he loves her. And though her room was closed, it brought her to a point of crying out to God. And who is she blessed with? Samuel, whom these next two books are literally written about. Literally, God saw her distress, but he had a plan for her. He had her to be driven to the point of constant and constant prayer and reliance on God. God didn't want to give Hannah just an ordinary child. He literally gave her a tri a child that would start the beginning of ending the cycle, the constant cycle of repeating sin, going to God, having a leader, and then going back to it again. And God was using Hannah to have the son to break that cycle. See, at the end of the chapter, uh you know, this young man Samuel is brought to the temple to be trained uh under Eli and it's really incredible because you really see Hannah's response and that you know um under times of great distress once you actually overcome it the way God wants you to overcome that it will be the most fruitful time of your entire life. and that God after Hannah's distress, she bore a son who is going to be the savior of the nation. So literally once you go through the distress the way God wants you to get through it, then it will literally be the most fruitful time of your life. And what it is is that you have to go farther in the fire. You know, you have to go deeper in the water. The go it says that God wants to save you from many rushing waters. So you can't go where it shallow. You have to go deep in the water so that God may save you and that God may use you. And it's so easy to focus on your distress, but God wants you to look outwardly for the many people that he is using you to help save. And you know what's incredible is that we're about to see two souls saved today. Amen. And that's what happens like when you become a disciple. I I'm sure you you can all relate to it. You're in distress when someone meets you. You're in distress. Like when I was studying the Bible, I'm like, man, I am so grateful for this. I was blind the first few Bible studies, but then I was like, what am I kidding? Like the my past few years before studying the Bible, they were terrible. And I was so grateful for God answering my cries. And so I want to encourage you that distress isn't just for the loss. that God could be pushing you to do, pushing you out of your comfort zone, what you don't think that you're capable of doing, so he can use you for something far greater than you could ever imagine. And that if you're a disciple and there's anguish, I want to challenge you, don't stop praying. If you're in distress, keep crying out to God and let him use you. Point number two, joyful gratitude or destructive entitlement. Joyful gratitude, destructive entitlement. And 1st Samuel chapter 2, it says in verse one, \"Hannah prayed, my heart rejoices in the Lord. My horn is lifted up by the Lord. My mouth boasts over my enemies because I rejoice in your salvation. There is no one holy like the Lord. There is no one besides you. And there is no rock like our God.\" See, Hannah sings this song of joy. And why is she joyful? Because she's grateful. Because of the son she was just given. And it's incredible because she gave her son over as a priest and she only would see her son once a year. And so, but she was so overjoyed by the fact that God had given to her and answered her prayers. And you know, she sends him off to work with the priest, but she would think that, okay, I'm going to send my son off with these religious men, religious people, and that they'll be a great influence, right? You know, good company will help him be a good person. fools. Let's see what actually happens when he when she sent her son over. 1st Samuel 2:12. Eli's sons were wicked men. Tough deal, huh? You know, you want your your son to have a great experience and it was a a terrible experience, right? Uh they did not respect the Lord or the priest's share of the sacrifices from the people. When anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a threepronged meat fork while the meat was boiling and plunge it into the container kettle uh cauldron or cooking pot. The priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up. This uh is the way they treated all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh. Um, even before the fat was burnt, the priest's servant would come and say to the one who was sacrificing, give the priest some meat to roast because he won't accept boiled meat from you, only raw. If that person said to him, uh, the fat must be burned first, then you can take whatever you want for yourself. See, this person is trying to stand up for for the Bible. They're like, you you're trying to take it, but like I know you're a priest, but I know the Bible. That's not what it says, right? Um, and then this is what it says. The servant would reply, \"No, I insist that you hand it over right now. If you don't, I will take it by force.\" So the servant sin was very severe in the presence of the Lord because the men treated the Lord's offering with contempt. See, this is the situation, right? So the they were priests under the Levitical law. And under the Levitical law, and you read in the Old Testament, they were supposed to burn it. Burn all the fat off and then they could have it, right? And almost think what this is like. Who loves like a nice fresh just I didn't even say I'm saying a nice fresh cooked on the cast iron skillet medium rare steak. And when that fat is burning, it's sizzling, you put some butter on it, the rosemary with it, you know, maybe a little thyme, but not too much, you know, salt and pepper, that's it. It smells like a pleasing aroma. And that's how God feels. It's just it's just grace. And you know what? The priest saw that and they're like, I want some of that. I I want that. Why does God have to have the fat horses? I want that. That sounds looks really good. And so before they would burn it, they would boil it or they would have it out and they said, \"No, give it to me raw. I want it before you burn it off.\" And so really what they were doing is that they were taking God's portion for themselves. That's what we're really reading here. And you know, it's really sad because even the people would say, \"You can't do that. Like I know you're a priest. I know you're supposed to be helping me with my sin offering and my guilt offering, but like that's wicked, too. like you can't be doing that. But what they said in response to the people trying to correct them was like essentially like you know this fight, you know, like I'm I'm gonna take it to you take it from you by force. Like I'm either going to take it or you're going to go down and I'm gonna punch you in the face and I'm going to take it back, you know. And that's that's what they were willing to do. And it's really sad because in verse 29, let's read it. A man of God comes to them and just flat out rebukes Eli and his sons. Uh he says in verse 29 of chapter 2, \"Why then do all of you despise my sacrifices and offerings I require at the place of worship? You have honored your sons more than me by making yourselves fat with the best part of all the offerings of my people Israel.\" So literally this man comes to them, he rebukes them. He says, \"You're taking all the fat and it's making you fat.\" you know, and it's it's really a sad case that to be the the leader of Israel of self-indulgence and not going by the word of God. And um you know, it's in direct contrast to Hannah. Hannah gave her son and was overflowing with joy and gratitude. The Levites were given two. They their portion is what people give as their sin offerings and they eat the food. But they wanted more. And you see this really terrible comparison of the two opposite sides of the spectrum. You can give to God and be overjoyed and thankful even though you only see your son once a year or you can be given to from the people around you and only desire more. And it's a real sad state for Israel. And you know it says that they were showing contempt for God's offerings. And you know we're going to talk about contribution for a sec. You know, I know we had our contribution portion and you know, talking about money is a hot topic, so don't pick up your pitchforks and your torches yet. You know, bear with me. Uh, but the word contempt in the Hebrew is the and it literally means irreverence that they showed irreverence towards God's sacrifices. You know, right now as a church, we're averaging every single week for the past few weeks, 20% of people don't give. Imagine you got your paycheck and your I used to work for a moving company and my boss he would because he got paid in cash he would pay us in cash, right? And I can imagine my boss handing me and he's giving my actual physical check as proof of what I owed my hours. But I can imagine him kind of giving me the money. Oh wait, I'm gonna take that back. There you go. And I can only imagine what that Can you guys imagine what that would be like if you're given your bi-weekly or monthly paycheck and your boss says, \"Oh, scratch that. Sorry. here's a lesser amount because I I want the other 20%. How would you guys feel in that moment? Yeah, you you'd be out outraged, you know, like I worked for that money. Why are you taking it from me? And it's the same thing like it is a portion that is owed to God. And for us, the 20% is simply based off of what we've already decided to give, what you have already decided to give. And we have to be sure to honor what we've decided to do. make our yes be yes. And I know what it's like living in Miami under hard times. It almost felt like every single week like oh wow like we're under this week and like the next week we're more under than last week and then it's like wow like it's not getting better. Like it just gets progressively worse. And for them it was contempt. It was irreverence. So the difference really is this. You know, even though we're under, you could be under hard times, maybe you forget. The a reverence is saying, \"Ah, well, whatever.\" Like, \"It's okay. Like, it's just money. It's just going, you know, to the church and the finances.\" Like, I know I owed it, but it's totally fine. But reverence is like, \"Dang, I missed it. I'm so sorry. I'm going to do my best to make it up. I'm going to do my best to treat this command the same way I treat all of God's commands.\" Imagine if the disciples sitting next to you showed irreverence towards denying themselves. It's like, oh well, like I just I choose deny myself only like three out of seven days a week, but like it's it's totally fine if I I do that. That's okay, right? Or or reverence towards like sharing their faith. It's like, yeah, like sharing your faith, that's for you. That's not really for me. I'm really trying to work myself there and I'll kind of do it later when I feel a bit better, you know? Or or maybe it's just any other part of your walk with God. we would be alarmed. We have to treat giving to God the same exact way. We have to show reverence towards this command. Um and why? Because we want, you know, to be a collection of disciples who have strong convictions to to be completely sold out. We shouldn't be like the priests where it's, you know, scriptures for me, scriptures for thee and not for me. The Bible applies to you, but for me, I'm a priest, so I'm okay. I've been around a while. It's totally fine. But we shouldn't be acting like the priests. We if we want to see a a family of disciples fully committed, it starts with you. It starts with each individual deciding to be fully committed. Um and so we you know we ask you know people to to give a tithe and you know if you're unable to even give that portion then give generously. Give what you can give. And if ti if tithing is not generous to you, then give more than a tithe. But we have to give to God. That is the commands. You know, um you know, Eli's sons were even more wicked than this. In verse 22, uh it literally says uh verse 22 26, you can write this down, that they were uh sleeping with the women that were ministering before the temple. And it's really two wicked things happening. One, um, you have women being in the men's roles and men not leading where they're supposed to be leading. And so it creates this issue where you have the the priests, you know, they're showing contempt, irreverence towards giving. And where there's smoke, there's fire. And so now they're not only reverent towards God and they're giving, but they're literally sleeping with the woman that they're supposed to be ministering to. I am so grateful to be a part of a family that has high standards for purity. Um, you know, um, I saw Kiara here, but Travis and Kiara, they're about to get married. And you know, Travis is a young strapping dapper man. And, you know, seemingly irresistible, but you know, the reality is that they're waiting till marriage and their first kiss will be at the altar. And that's what we do here as a family. We uphold purity. We not only protect our own purity, but we protect the purity of the brothers and sisters and men and women around us. And so we uphold not just this standard, but every standard in the Bible. Amen. And we do our best to show reverence so that we can fight for it. Uh let's keep reading. Let's go to um uh 1 Samuel chapter 3. Actually, sorry. Let's go back a little bit. uh verse 25 of chapter 2 some something actually very key I don't want to skip over uh in verse 25 that man who I'll say came to rebuke them it says that uh when he came to rebuke uh them basically Eli was also realizing this and Eli said to his sons kind of before the man came and said that um what you're doing is wicked but it says that the sons were not willing to listen they would not listen to their father since the lord intended to kill And it it's quite significant because, you know, we learned this if you're taking it and you're in sin or you're in a pattern of sin or you feel like you can't repent and you can't come to God, you know, it only takes uh an ounce of humility, only a little bit, just say just with the the smallest ounce of energy, you know what, maybe I'm wrong. I I I I do need a change. And if if you could even muster that up, there is still hope for you. But the issue with these men is that they were unwilling to listen. And you know, if you are not willing to admit that you're wrong, not willing to even take an understanding that maybe there's an area of your life that someone keeps bringing up to you that you have to change. If you're unwilling to see that, then there is no hope for you. There is there's no way God can work through that because you're unwilling to listen. And in verse 27, it talks it goes back to Samuel. And the idea was that it says that these men God intended to kill them because God was raising up their replacement. He was raising up Samuel. And so we see that if we're unwilling to change, if you're unwilling to repent, even though God was helping you to see in your distress what you need and that you need him so that he can use you, if you're unwilling to see it and you cannot be used by him, God will just use someone else. He will just go on to the next person. And I think, you know, some of us, you know, even recently, I think we've seen people who can be idolatrous in leadership. You know, people who use their power for terrible gain. Um, and maybe it's, you know, they stay and they they cause unneeded persecution. You know, people who don't have to be persecutors and now they're persecuting because of our terrible decisions, someone else's terrible decisions, right? Um, but because of that, we cannot swing fully to the opposite direction. The answer to, you know, Sinful leadership isn't no leadership. It is righteous leadership. Amen. The answer to uh unspirituality isn't no spirituality. It is spirit and truth. Amen. Uh the answer to you know people spreading false doctrine, terrible doctrine, spreading aside like setting aside people for their own wicked beliefs and teaching myths is you don't go to no doctrine because of false doctrine. You want sound doctrine. And so we cannot swing the opposite way. We have to actually approach it the way God wants. Even God say, you know, yes, these men, these priests are wicked, but I still want a leader. I still want somebody to raise up and lead my people. Uh point number three, 1st Samuel chapter 3, last point. Before the lamp goes out, uh and before we read this passage, uh I want us to think about this. You know, there are scriptures uh that are in a specific context, but passages aren't always locked um in the scenario that they're written in. And so, we're about to read a passage and it applies to the context, but it doesn't mean it was only applicable in that moment. And we actually see a greater meaning when our circumstances even today match very similar circumstances. In 1 Samuel chapter 3, it says uh the boy Samuel served in uh the Lord and Eli in Eli's presence. In those days, the word of the Lord was rare and prophetic visions were not widespread. One day, Eli whose eyes sight was failing was lying in his usual place before the lamp of God, God had gone out. Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was located. We're going to focus in on three things in this passage. The first thing it says was the word of the Lord was rare. The word of the Lord was rare. And this is significant. They had priests. They were giving sacrifices. They had a judge. And they had, you know, even people who seemingly understood the Bible in some sense. And so, religion was not rare. But the word of the Lord was rare. Even in today's world, religion is not rare, but the word of the Lord is very rare today. Let's go to second Timothy chapter 4. Second Timothy chapter 4. 7:3 For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine but according to their own desires will multiply teachers for themselves because they have been itched to hear what their ears want to hear. They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths. See, here's what this passage says for the people then and the people always is that as long as there are people who just want to hear what they want to hear, they will be teachers that will give that to them. Not because it's truth, not because what the Bible says, but to appease their own desires. And what it is that people, they want to be told that everything is fine, that everything's okay, that every everyone that they love is going to heaven, and everyone that they don't know is questionable. That's what everyone wants to hear. You know, that even if they're sleeping around, they're smoking pot, they're going to clubs, but they go to church, they read the Bible, and that they have other friends that confirm with them, they have a pastor who seemingly says that he loves them, that it's okay, we're all going to heaven, even though we're totally wicked. People love that message. And what happens is every scripture becomes a recommendation. every scripture just becomes, you know, better practice, not the only practice. And the Bible itself, it no longer becomes the word of God. It is now what atheists view as a self-help book. That is optional, but that is not the word of God. And it says that, you know, we turn aside to myths. What it is is that we turn to what sounds pleasing. We turn to what sounds nice. And if the word of the Lord is rare, we have to be people that uphold the value of the Bible and what it's meant to be. Let's go to Jeremiah chapter 23. Hope you guys are following me. I know we got a you got a lot of passages. You know, you got to wiggle it out. You got to stand up. I know you're sometimes you're in an airplane, you're in, you know, 10 15 hours and they say just stand up. Just walk around. Do you have to do that? I totally understand. And yet the seat belt sign is off. You can stand up in Jeremiah chapter 23. It says in verse 25, I have heard what the prophets who prophesy a lie in my name have said, I had a dream. I had a dream. How long will this continue in the minds of the prophets prophesying lies? Pro uh prophets of deceit of their own minds. Though their dreams uh that they tell one another, they plan to uh they plan to cause my people to forget my name as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. The prophet who has only a dream should recount that dream. But the one who has my word should speak my word truthfully. For what is a straw compared to grain? It this is the Lord's declaration is not my word like a fire. This is the Lord's declaration and like a hammer that pulverizes rock. You know, it's really incredible. I'm sure you've met people. They love the prophesy. They love telling you their dreams, what it means, and how great it is and what it means for you. I had this vision for you. A spirit told me this, and that's great to hear, but it means nothing compared to the Bible. And we have to be people that uphold the word of God. And in this instance, it really talks about people. What happened was in this time, you know, the the Israelites, the people from Judah, they were being taken captive by Babylon. And God gave these prophets, say, \"Hey, like go tell them that they're going to be in captivity for 70 years. And like probably a third of you, a fourth of you, even less, will only live.\" And they would go, these prophets would preach that and the people would hate that. And so what did the prophets do? They toned down the message. What they did is Oh, you know, maybe the Babylonians will do that bad to us. God will really spite us with plagues only for a little bit and it won't be 70 years. It'll be a bit less than 70 years. So, in a very literal sense, what they were doing was they were prophesying a a softer judgment and a shorter punishments. You know, that's what people want to hear. They want to hear that maybe you die, you you're in a a moment of brief uh median state where you burn a little bit and you dust it off and then you go right back to God as if it nothing ever happens. But that is not the truth. You know, judgment is eternal. And you know, we have to preach the eternal message. The Bible is a fire and a hammer that smashes. And I like it because it smashes rock. And I've never seen imagine someone taking a hammer and like smashing like a massive boulder. I've never seen that. So you immediately say, \"Wow, this is a very unique hammer. I've never seen anything like that.\" And the person wielding it is also a very unique individual. And uh it's great to hear because even though it it smashes, it burns. Those are frightening things. And the reality is that if you're living in comfort and you don't really see your life as that bad and you think you're doing totally okay, when you hear the word of God, it's going to be like a horror story to you. You're going to hear it and like, \"This is terrible. This is confusing. I don't like it. You're prophesying crazy stuff. The word of God is crazy. You're in a cult. I don't want to be around here anymore.\" But that's what happens when you live in a comfortable state of life. But for people who are living that horror story, for people that are the ones being traumatized, who everything everything they see around them is terrible, want to find a way to get out of it, then the Bible to them will be like a beautiful work of arts. They finally take their eyes off of the horror in their lives and they see a future for them, a possibility for them because that is who the word of God is to people that actually cry out to them in their distress. And so we have to be people that uphold the Bible. And so we cannot be those that water down the message and tone it down. And instead of saving people with the Bible, we end up saving people from the Bible. We can't do that. We have to uphold the standard of the word of God. See, even though the word of God is rare, we cannot let it be rare in this room. Amen. We cannot let it be rare the moment we walk out when we share our faith and talk with people and really talk about wow the salvation that God has the beauty that God has for anyone who's living a life in total distress. Uh the other thing that talks about in 1 Samuel uh chapter 3 is that Eli's eyes were becoming weak. Uh let's go to John chapter 3. and his eyes becoming weak um because he can barely see that it's really symbolic of uh not only an absence in God's word but an absence in clear direction that the judge the leader of Israel couldn't see. He had no vision. They didn't know where he was going. Um and you know when you don't have clear direction everything just seems confusing to you. I don't know if anyone can share that. Um, but in John chapter 3, let's look at probably one of the more clearer directions, the Bible. In verse one, there is a man from the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to him at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one can perform these signs you do, unless God will listen with him.\" Jesus replied, \"Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. How can anyone be born when he's old?\" Nicodemus asked him, \"Can he enter his mother's womb as in a second time and be born?\" Jesus answered, \"Truly I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Whatever is born of flesh is flesh, whatever is born of the spirit is spirit. Do not be amazed that I told you that you must be born again.\" And so, a Pharisee, uh, a ruler of Jews. You could literally call him a Bible expert. He could have his PhD in scripture knowledge, ask him a question, and he knows it. He goes to Jesus, \"Hey, I know you're the Messiah. We all know you're the Messiah.\" And then he acknowledges his deity. He knows that he's from God, but he says you cannot even see the kingdom unless you're born again. And this Bible expert is confused. It's like, what do you mean by that? Why? Because those even though you recognize the deity of Jesus, unless you're willing to be born again, it'll be confusing to you. God's word will be confusing to you unless you're willing to totally accept it. And you know, it's very clear even what the passage is saying. But the reason why, you know, he's blind is because he wasn't willing to accept it. You know, he said that he must be born again of water and the spirits. And those things work together because what is born of flesh is flesh. So people take this passage and it's like, well, the water was the mother, the womb, you know, in the womb you have the water going on in there and, you know, it's the uh amniotic fluid and that's the water. But then you're born of the spirit later on. But that is still being born of flesh. It makes no logical sense. And I've heard people use this argument, but it's confusing. Water and spirit. God is giving you a solution. And the solution is very, very clear. But the thing is that people would rather be blind and believe that you're right than actually be willing to be confronted and accept that they're wrong. And you know the reality is they have to find some way to be comforted by the thoughts that maybe there were rights when they're not with God. And what happens is you can believe all that you want to be right but it's not about you. I love uh Romans chapter 3. Uh it literally says may all men be liars. And the reality is that before God we're all liars. We don't know anything. It is God's word that brings truth in our lives. So if you think you're right and you want to find comfort with that, amen. But God will still judge you. Amen. Acts chapter 2 verse 38, we all know the passage. It literally says, \"Repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of your sins.\" Written by translating scholars, most of them who do not believe, you have to get baptized. And they still write for the forgiveness of your sins. And yet you can still be in a Bible study and someone say, \"Well, the Greek word for is eyes.\" And sometimes it means because of, right? Because of the forgiveness of sins. You've already been forgiven and then you get baptized later. Well, you know, that's interesting logic because there's a very similar passage in Matthew 26. Let's have some very clear direction. Amen. Matthew 26 and verse 28. The Bible reads, \"For this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\" Many people agree obviously Jesus died so that your sins may be forgiven for the forgiveness of your sins and that you don't receive forgiveness until Jesus dies for you. And it makes logical sense. It's written in the same exact Greek grammar structure. But when they read Acts chapter 2, somehow it's reversed. It's confusing to them. Why? Because they're unwilling to accept the truth. See, we have to be willing to uphold God's word and have very clear direction in what the Bible says. Amen. The last thing it says in first in 1 Samuel 3 that the lamp had not yet gone out. Let's go to Revelation chapter 1. Coming in for a landing here. Revelation chapter one. Let's see what the another passage says about the lamp. In Revelation chapter one, it says in verse 20, the Bible reads, \"The mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven golden lampstands is this, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.\" Okay. It's really cool when sometimes Revelation gives you the answer to its revelation. Sometimes it's it's mystic, you know, it's cryptic. It doesn't mean anything. But then sometimes if you keep reading, the answer is right there, which I'm grateful for. But it talks about this lampstand is is it's very symbolic in God's eyes. And God is eternal. So his symbolism is also eternal. Amen. And the lampstand is referring to God's people, literally the church. Right? So let's go to chapter 2 verse 5. It says, \"Remember then how far you have fallen. Repent and do the works you did at first. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from his place unless you repent.\" So the lampstand is the church. So how does God go to his people who are unwilling to repent and remove their lampstand? Does he like just smite them and they're removed from the face of the earth? No. The idea was that at some point, even though you get together, you congregate, you worship God, at some point God can make you no longer a church if you don't repent. And that you can still gather, you can have services, you can have your quiet times, you can read your Bible, but it does not mean that you are a church in God's sight. So, we have to be very careful to actually use this chance of being in God's kingdom and not take it for granted because we cannot be entitled and just assume that we'll always have this opportunity. So, how do we actually use this opportunity? Go to Isaiah chapter 5. We're going to look at two passages that that warn us what happens when we don't make the best of opportunity of being in the kingdom. In Isaiah chapter 5, as we read this, uh, think if it sounds uh, familiar to any other passage in the New Testament, Isaiah 5:1, I will sing about the one I love, a song about my loved ones vineyard. The one I loved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. He broke up the soil, cleared it of stones, planted it with the finest vines. He built a tower in the middle of it, and even dug out a wine press there. He expected it to yield good grapes, but it yielded worthless grapes. So now, residents of Jerusalem, men of Judah, please judge between me and my vineyard. What more could I have done for my vineyard than I did? Why, when I expected a yield of good grapes, did it yield worthless grapes? Now, I will tell you what I am about to do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge and it will be consumed. I will tear it down. I will tear down its wall and it will be trampled. I will make it a wasteland. It will not be pruned for or weeded. Thorns and briars will grow up. I will give orders to the clouds that will rain uh should not fall on it. For the vineyard of the Lord of armies, in the house of Israel and the men of Judah, and the plant uh he delighted in, he expected justice but sought injustice. He expected righteousness but heard cries of despair. See, what did God come looking for? When God came back to the vineyard, what did he expect to see? Good fruit, right? But what does he see? Is wicked fruits. He expected one thing but saw the complete opposite. But you know, sometimes you look at the passage like, oh well, like you know, the God of the Old Testament, he God is different now in the New Testament, he's changed his personality. you know, he's he's not as, you know, the way he was, you know, in the now he's he we had to do all these things in the Old Testament. Now we have to do nothing in the New Testament. Totally different God. That's what people might think, but that's totally wrong. We have to uphold what Bible the Bible says about him. In Matthew 21 in verse 33, uh, you know, it talks about God having the same exact venue. And you know because this is now God in the flesh and he talks about this vineyard and he hires tenants for this vineyard. And these tenants were supposed to look after it just like you read in Isaiah chapter 5. And when he came that when he came God sent workers to go and receive the harvest. And worker after worker it says that they beat them. They they they totally you know embarrassed them. They sent them back emptyhanded. And so Jesus telling this parable, he then says, \"Well, maybe if I send my son that they'll respect my son.\" But then these tenants, they also kill the son. Symbolizing Jesus. And so Jesus turns to the Pharisees and then he asks, \"What do you think the owner will do?\" In verse 40, 41, Matthew 21, the they respond, \"He will completely destroy those terrible men.\" They told him, \"And lease his vineyard to an other farmers who will give him his fruit at the harvest.\" What's the difference here between tenants, tenants and farmers? Tenants and workers is that tenants just sit there and they sit around and they live there, but they don't do any work. But God wants his vineyard to be worked by farmers, people who will actually produce the fruit that he wants it to see. you know, being here in Tampa that I can't wait to see regions here in Tampa, you know, to see a region in St. Petersburg, you know, to to see a a region maybe a small little house church in Lakeland, you know, in Sarasota, in all these different areas. And we're going to need Bible talks to be here in the beginning. And the question is, who's going to go? Yeah. Now, I just want to see how you're going to react, right? Like, someone has to go. We have to produce the fruits that God wants. Let's go back to the first Samuel chapter 3. And uh quickly summarizing, you know, God comes to Eli, comes to Samuel. Uh Samuel has these visions. Samuel tells Eli um and then it's just confirmed that God is talking to Samuel and that now all of Israel knows that Samuel is a prophet. And then later on in the passage, because of Eli and his son's wickedness, at one point they go off to battle. And in this battle, you know, a lot of Israel's army, they die. Uh Eli's own sons die as a consequence to their sin. And then in verse 17, Eli hears this message and the messenger answered, \"Israel has fled from the Philistines and also there was a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hoffne and Phineas, are both dead, and the ark of God has been captured.\" When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off the chair by the city gate. And since he was old and heavy, his neck broke and died. Eli had judged Israel 40 years. So the the message just constantly got worse as he was hearing it. Israel fled. He got destroyed. Heavy losses. His sons were dead. And then the ark of God being taken was the last straw. And he just falls over and he dies. And you know it's pretty significant because the ark being taken why was that the one that hit home? Because for many people it was symbolic of wow God has left us. But that's not true because as we read earlier the lamp of the Lord had not yet gone out. So even though the people felt that God wasn't with them God was actually still very much with them. And and if you think about it from a holistic perspective, how many people if all the if the priests were dead, how many people at this moment in time would actually know that the lamp is still burning? Not very many. But then it's showing that God was still with the people even if they felt like they were not. You know, I I think, you know, right now in our movement, maybe I think some people might think, is God really with us right now? You know, we're going through hard times, times of distress, all these changes, people leaving. You know, are we really doing what God wants us to do? And I want to encourage you that even if you feel that way, the lamp of God is still burning bright. And I know it's burning bright because when I see, you know, Rod singing in front, there's a fire burning in him. You know, when I see Aussie, there's a fire burning in Aussie and in Kyle, you know, and in There's this fire that is burning bright in us. And as long as we keep this fire, maintain this fire. Want to let this fire spread and let God's word be known that God is still with us. And we don't have to feel this way. That we can still advance God's kingdom with the fire that he wants us to advance us. And so that if we can do that, we can break the cycle. No longer live in this constant repetition. The lamp of God is still burning. We can be totally con uh full of conviction, completely sold out and see our times as of distress as times to get closer to God. So let us continue to pursue God's kingdom and let God's kingdom grow and let him see the fruit that he wants to see. God be all",

    "transcript": "you know the lesson I just want to give you guys uh a license or or permission uh that if I say something that inspires you or that maybe convicts you uh to let me know with a little verbal CU you know what I'm saying like like a little like amen or little come on bro or something uh if what I say is like is totally wack out there then let me know as well like Bo you know amen I I just want to know that you're listening you know what I'm saying it helps me to know that you're listening uh turn your Bible to Hebrews chapter 2 you know uh Malik asked me uh basically last night to preach a lesson and uh sometimes to be like that you got to be prepared amen um and I was going to recycle lesson I had already written but I was actually supposed to do communion today so that's what I Was preparing but I was you know what let me take this communion and put it into a lesson and so hopefully it makes sense hopefully you guys you know get something from it but it's really what's been on my heart uh as of late Hebrews 2 starting in verse 10 the Bible reads in bringing many sons and daughters to Glory it was fitting that God for whom and through whom every everything exists should be the pioneer of their salvation I'm sorry should make the pioneer of their salvation uh perfect through what was suffered both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family so Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters he says I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters in the assembly I will sing your praises and again I will put my trust in him and again he saids here I am and the children God has given me since the children have Flesh and Blood he too shared in their Humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death that is the devil and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death for surely he is not uh he is not Angel sry it is not angel that he helped but Abraham's descending for this reason he had to be made like them fully human in every way in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people you know I love this passage it's packed with so much full information but ultimately what do we need to know that Jesus came to Earth as God but he was fully human while he lived uh you know he experienced Humanity just as you and I did yet he did not sin which is pretty incredible to think about but the Bible says that he was made perfect uh and this concept just like kind of baffled my mind because it's like well Jesus is good he's always perfect and we see it kind of retroactively but Jesus had to go through his 32 years of life uh Jesus was tempted in many ways and it says that he was made perfect out by what he suffered uh and and you know this word perfect it it means complete uh and it's used many times about the Bible sometimes as perfect or sometimes as complete but that's what it's saying that Jesus was made perfectly made complete by his life because of the trials because of the suffering that he endured uh some directly was tempted by Satan some he was persecuted by people but he endured all that without ever giving into temptation without ever giving into sin and that's what made him perfect that's what made him it wasn't just like this and no matter what he did he was going to be perfect no he had a check self every day and make sure he didn't get in and he did it and he's an example for I to follow you know the other cool thing about this passage it teaches us that uh you know Jesus has brothers and sisters uh the family of God and who are they it's those that are being made holy or being made like Jesus being made perfect as well and so the family of God consists of those uh who endure suffering in this life and also do not give into temptation and also who strive to live just as Jesus lived and so that's what we all are all about amen uh we are the family of God uh you are my brothers and sisters even if you're V visiting we hope you feel like family because we don't just take the word of God and you know listen to it and like oh that feels good and then go on with our lives no we make it our lives uh this is your Christianity is what you do Saturday through Monday or you know say Monday through through Saturday Sunday is what we come and we get to worship God and we get to celebrate with the family and we get re-energized to go back out you know throughout the week uh and so you know what's so cool about our church is is you know we're we're all different ages you know some some pretty young some not so young amen uh I'm getting to that not so young you know stage in life amen uh you know all colors all backgrounds it doesn't matter God's family are those who obey the Bible God's family are those who listen to the word and do it uh and and you know when you make mistakes that you you don't hide it but that you get open you deal with it and you deal with your life and that's what we're all about the title of my lesson is made perfect Jesus was made perfect it's a cool concept to think about because you know sometimes even for us we can think that we're just like inherently awesome you know uh we just we just kind of deserve our spot in heaven or something like that you know and maybe we wouldn't say that out loud but you our hearts is kind of how we act uh but even Jesus as soon as he came down to earth he understood what was that at risk Satan tried everything to get him to keep him from going back up to heaven uh but he he wasn't about it he said I have to pass this P I have to be the perfect sacrifice for everybody that would come after me uh look at James chapter one you know what's what's you I'm not going to go there one of the most convicting stt in the Bible Matthew 5 Jesus actually says to be perfect uh and I don't even want to read that like how am I gonna be perfect but but hopefully this this sermon will help you understand what that means what it means and how you in fact can be perfect and if you don't if that's not your goal if that's not what you know you're really striving for then are you really striving to be like Jesus anyway James James chapter one all right the Bible says in chapter 1 verse two consider it pure joy my brothers and sisters whenever you face Trials of many times because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance let perseverance finish its word so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything uh the same word here is completed it's the same as as perfect uh and and it says that the way to grow the way to become perfect become mature and complete is you have to persevere through the trial of and tribulations and that's what we understand what Jesus did uh and so for us you know I think for for me for sure and I know for just all people we always try to avoid suffering right uh we we we want like the most comfortable bed we can find right we want you know the most comfortable seats we can find you know in our in our vehicle you want heated seats we want cool seats we want a heated steering wheel you know we just all about comfort you know uh and and and that's that's America for you right it's like we we do everything we spend the money to get Comfort but here Jesus says to be joyful and consider it pure joy when You Face trials when you're uncomfortable in your life why because that's the only way to become mature and complete is you have to go through the testing of your faith uh similarly in Romans 5:3 it says that we rejoice in our suffering because we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope uh and I and I just love these passages because it it challenges me it it really challenges my heart because I know that when I'm not thinking about it when I'm just kind of going through my life without even you know having to to think about it I'm like okay what do I what can I do to to take the shortcut to take the easy road to to make life easier for myself you know and I'm always trying to do that but but you can't live that way and and and Live Like Jesus that's it's the opposite you know and so you know the idea here is not that you just like okay let me find out how I can suffer let me go like you know hurt myself or do something for the sake of it of course not but but it says like when suffering comes that we Rejoice because now this is an opportunity given by God that I can grow that I can persevere that I can have character you know you know I think everybody here wants to grow in their character right uh well to pursue character is to pursue suffering to pursue character is to pursue suffering again not meaning that you seek out suffering but that you invite it that when it comes to your doorstep you let it on in you don't run away from it uh you know I was really encouraged talking to Jaden actually he's about to be baptized and it's funny because he was you know even at midweek he was sharing uh that he started the Bible studies and then when he got through the discipleship study and he realized like you know and I've seen this a lot it's like oh yeah you know I'm not a disciple but I'm I'm still a Christian I'm saved but then when you realized like who disciples equal script equal sh and it's like you see it in the Bible and then you look at your life was just like oh my gosh this is intense and and Jen went through that and he ran away uh it's like no no I can't I can't do this and it was a couple years that he ran away but then finally God humbled him out a little bit brought him low into to see his KN for God like all right fine I'm ready I'm ready to do whatever it takes and I know he he he went through it real quick whatever I gotta do let's do it um and and that's what it looks like to persevere that's what it looks like to to grow in your character and have that true P um you know what's cool also about character and I also find this very fting is that it's it's it's a noun the word in the Bible character is a uh meaning is not a verb uh and and I think when I realized this which was interesting because I think for us like we think about even the fruits of the spirit those are all noun love joy peace patience kindness goodness stand selfcontrol and I think what happens though is we try to figure out what does it look like how do I act so control how do I act joyful what are what are the verbs what are the things I can do to appear this way but but that's not that's not true character true character is something you possess there's only one way to possess it it's it's suffering it's you're actually going through it actually going through the trials and tribulations that God is putting in your life persevering and that's how you possess character and so I have a question do do you have character this morning or are you just playing a character I've been there you know I think I remember when I got baptized uh this was the most challenging thing for me was I was a total character uh you know everything in my life I I literally lied to people about things that didn't make sense like you know instead of you know I'm a I'm a quarter Mexican true um but for some reason I used to tell people oh I'm I'm half Mexican I don't know why like what does that matter but but I just wanted I just I just I was caught up and always like lying to people about random things about you know myself because I just was afraid to really be who I was um and when I studied the Bible and when I dealt with the real issues in my life when I got open about things I had never told anybody before when I dealt with relationships and hatred and bitterness that I had never let go of I was free I was free to just be myself and and for me that was the most uh amazing feel ever uh was just like not have to play a character more you know but even as a disciple there's been times where I just know you know I'm not doing what I ought to be doing or I feel disheartened or I feel discouraged um and and I don't want people to know because I don't really want to do with it and so I just put on a character pretend like everything's fine uh but but of course now I'm forting I'm not being my uh and so for me the challenge is is to always take you know full advantage of of the tri and tribulations that God is putting for me and grow from it uh you know yesterday we had a Mary some of us some of us are are e to get into those things come on Michael but uh uh but you know it was so funny because uh I had heard Chris had told me Chris is in charge of you know the I meanon sorry Hilton and he had told me that that I don't know who but someone had told him that the Mary Evils are boring I don't know who said it I don't know but but you know amen amen um and you know when you hear that you could either just be critical you can like who are you are whatever you can make excuses uh sure I don't know I'm sure you temp I thought I you know I like well you think you do better you know I have a bad attitude about that but instead uh what what Chris did is is he made it and it you know Sam and I were kind of struggling because we were running L we drop our kids off and Brandon the whole thing uh and so we were just like not you know just trying to get in the door you know and then we showed up and you know I'm I'm wearing jeans and like a nice sweater I try to you know look a little bit nice but then Here Comes Chris and Mary Chris is like in a full tuxedo looking you know bow tie black and white Mary's white you know they're just like super official and they're like okay we're only letting in one couple at a time because we have to see and and I and I thought he was joking at oh come on let us in uh but he was like he like no dead serious and it took me like a few minutes to really like process that was happening but then as soon as we walked in and we were seated and they handed us like this official and there was like this is incredible and being at the Echo Place like by the water I was like holy like I was so encouraged and I was like this is perfect that's l i felt like this is perfect um but that only happened because Chris was able to take that criticism and and changeed you know what I'm saying and amen it's a it's a funny example but but that's a good example uh how how well do you take criticism how well you take when when someone points something out are you open to that that's the only way you're going to be able to grow and you know what that's what we do as family uh that's what discipling is all about we get in there like hey bro I noticed this and that it's like are you defensive you have excuses or are you willing to take a look and and and make those changes because that's how you become myud amen um if I can I want to share a little example for myself um you know I've gone through many different stages and and I've run away many many times from God blessing uh and it's never been good uh but just recently you know when when Sam and I moved back from Syracuse I needed the job and you know Cory and and a couple other disciples have worked at this place called C and all I knew about it was from before we moved to Syracuse Cory would always kind of like vent to me about the job because they would get on him that he wasn't working enough hours he was done so fast that that uh they're like you need to stay longer I don't know what to do and and and and the only reason why I wasn't didn't want to do the job is because we had a wake up at like 3:30 in the morning I I don't want to do that and so you know I spent like 15 years doing sales you know just sitting and selling phone um and and so to have to like work that hard and wake up that early I wasn't you know looking forward to that but when when we came back I just needed something so I took the job um and and I got like the opposite like load of work is uh and you know all his stops were super local and very quick my stops are up in like Spring Hill and Brooksville uh driving super far D City and it's different type of work uh and it's basically like the same sound like they paid more for that um and so initially I was really strugg uh and and I felt even envious you know I'm like it's not fair you get call like just so early I you know come back so late and I and even though I didn't like talk to him about this or like Let It kind of get out I think I probably my wife a lot but uh I was really struggling you know and uh I just I felt like it wasn't fair that's how I felt my God is fair and I knew this was some God you know because everything lined up perfectly you know from the came so I just I knew it from God and then I even applied like that was God um but but I just knew that this was God was trying to teach me something and even though I knew that I I really was I I didn't want to take a look and see what is it what is that got teaching me but then I got injured on the job uh and I was out like three weeks uh and it was during those three weeks that I I really had to refle and you know instead of complaining about the hard work I'm just complaining about not being bed um and so when I when I came back to work I told my I told my manager basically like hey just give me as much work like let me just work as hard as possible up until that point I had basically trying to get a shorter route or get you know easier work and of course that's not what they want to hear but anyways I just decided to have a different mindset and so uh you know they they gave me a much bigger workload and it's you know was like wow I had to really adjust but what I learned from from having that mindset is that g was trying to refine my character because I realized that when it came to especially at top I always prioritize like over uh you know I was like I'll take a job that's even like maybe a little bit less in if it was a closer drive or if was a little bit easier work or more convenient hours you know um and I always did it in the vein of well I just don't want to I want be but deep down I just I wanted to avoid like um and I didn't even realize this until I started working really hard um and and then I honestly felt like this is incredible like I'm so grateful that I would just open to God's you know uh testing here because I realize this is a part of my character that needs that isn't complete uh I have to I have to embrace the grind I have to be willing to work hard and in fact that's what the Bible says I'll just share the scripture uh sorry first Thessalonian 4 uh this is a hard scripture for me to be honest and it sounds like it almost sounds easy but but it's for me not first for okay go come on verse 11 1 4 ver1 wait it says and make it your ambition to lead a quiet life you should mind your own business and work hard with your your hands just as we told you so that your life may win the respect of Outsiders and so that you will not be be dependent on anybody that's a tough scripture um you know when I was a kid I would hear mind your own business uh but but that's not what this is talking about it's not like just but what it's saying is like you have your business right you have your life you have your your bills you have your responsibility are you minding those things or are you just concerned about what everybody else is doing that that's what the scripture is saying and it says that you should work hard with your hand so that your life may win the respect of of other people um and that you won't be dependent on anybody I don't know about you but that's something I I just hate being dependent on people and unfortunately because of my lack of care because of my lack of really uh putting myself to the gr there I I've put ourselves in sit where we've been dependent on people uh and it's my my lack of character and so anyways I just share that to people are vulnerable but I'm just grateful for the lessons I'm grateful that when when God puts you know and I'm sure this isn't the first time that God Tri this blessing this is the first time I'm listening amen um and so you know for you I just encourage you to think about your life you know think about the trials and tribulations that maybe are happening in your life uh and instead of making excuses maybe look inside and say okay what is God going to teach me what are the lessons what what are the things in the Bible that that I realize that that are off that are not like Jesus uh that are not complete uh because guys we're going to be growing and and trying to become like Jesus for the rest of our lives if we stay faithful amen all right Point number one point number one is perfect law perfect law uh look at James chapter one James 1 you know this is awesome scripture that we read in the word of God study uh but it's probably one of the most convicting in the Bible you know it talks about you know don't just look into a mirror and walk away without fixing yourself you know that would be that' be ridiculous but that's what it's like when you look at the Bible and then you don't do it it's like it's it's pointless it's fruitless uh but then it says in uh verse four no I'm sorry verse 25 James 1 verse2 it says but whoever doesn't matter who you are whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues in it not forgetting what they have heard but doing it they will be blessed in what they uh you know the whole point of the Bible is that we study it we read it we get super familiar with it why so that we can apply so that we do it that we live it out uh if you have the Bible and even if you read the Bible even if you memorize the Bible it means nothing if it doesn't change you if you're not actually putting you into practice what the word say uh let alone if you're not reading the Bible studying I mean you got to get started there uh but but the whole point of it is that you can apply it um and you know what's what's true as well is that the only thing that's going to change anybody else in your life is the Bible uh you know sometimes even I find myself talking to especially people that are close to me like family or longtime friends and I'm just like I know that you know the Bible studies is really where things to go but I'm a little bit maybe him or like I don't know what if they reject you know any studies what if they don't want to hear it until I find myself just thinking a words that I can of only the word um and and what's cool though is that if you are a baptized disciple you have the recipe you know exactly how to somebody's life do whatever was done with you uh you know I was really encouraged by our Bible on Friday and SHP people brother and then I realized oh maybe I'm not so good you know and then I repented of my sins and I got baptized you know it's really simple the Bible is stop whatever you're not doing that you you start doing that like Jesus that's repentance and then you get baptized for the Forgiveness of your sin get En Spirit today you know only bapti you don't don't somebody want young never you know what to amen um all right I want to read [Music] that while a large crowd was gathering for here that not believe those on theck are the on the word when they hear it but they have no Ro they believe for a while but if that fell on the thn stand for those Fe but as they go on their way they are and not but the seed on good s stands for those with a noble and good heart who hear the word retain it and by persevering a and and I love this this is [Music] what seed that was planted in our hearts and this is as disciples what we're doing we're spreading the seed to all the people uh but yet we don't know we don't get to see somebody and say oh there's a good heart right there we don't know and so just like this armor he spreads it everywhere and that's what we're all about as kingdom of God we're about spreading the word of God everywhere to find those people that have good and Noble heart but even for us you know once once good and Noble heart not always good no heart uh you know we can revert back and we can find ourselves in the form just worried stressed out about life what's going to happen about bills uh it's real you know uh you know you get married you have some kids and you start to feel a little bit of stress put a pressure about life right there but if you let those things overtake you or you're more concerned about that and your own personal relationship with God your own heart before God then then you become in and and either you know as a displ you're either growing or you're there's no if you're not growing Spirit U maybe you find yourself you know with a shallow relationship with God no you find yourself you know not really being able to got and you know what it Tak got to break up the you got to do whatever it takes sometimes you run away maybe not you haven't run away physically from the church but you run away from God you don't want to deal with God and what that is know not you you know that no matter need some you probably do uh that's what we're all about come know Cann amen all right Point number two is perfect love first John there is no fear in love but perfect love dri out Fe one not we love here that's the north that's the uh your soul you don't have that's fear you're afraid know mind have to and I know body our own you know bad phys physical health but you I believe that mental health is very much like that badal way you know I find that course like on media that's a badal health chice know I'm say uh know having a VI mentality bad you need to break out of that healthy spiritually mentally physically uh God wants that that's the only way you're going to be able to love amen number is perfect will ROM Romans 12 starting verse one says therefore I urge you brothers and sisters in view of God's mercy to offer your body as a Living Sacrifice only and God this is your this is your true Ander do not con to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to and approve what God's will is good pleasing and perfect will you know God has a perfect will a perfect plan for your life you really believe that uh it's incredible to think about because we can B it up you know I heard this it's all and I thinky met know all about life is all about realizing that you're off somewhere you're not compl area being okay with that but then dealing you know to who Jesus is Jesus and we're constantly off let me tell you but that's why we have the word you know God that's why that you that you gr that's the only way and if you take but when you really embrace the suffer when you really embrace the child when you really Embrace and grow from it through the word through disciples through the kingdom that's how you become like Jesus that's how you become um and so I just want to encourage you you know uh few Talent number one you know I I think that I don't know about you but when I look at this space and and how much he occupy it it's it's a little it's a little big for us right but it doesn't have to be that way um and you know I think I gave my my Bible talk a challenge a couple weeks ago that if everybody just finds one new person to do a seeking God study with then then we'll celebrate we're going to go to wey watch amen and give a little motivation there uh and so we've been going after that uh and there's some people in the Bible talk that have never let a Bible study before but we're going to make it happen and everybody in the Bible talk is going to lead a Bible study um and so I want to give you guys the same Talent uh find one new person to sit down and study the Bible uh just that's it don't think you know they [Music] maybe um and you know my Second Challenge is to to be the good soil to just be honest you know be you know honest about where you're really at and and don't try to be a character but let's get some character amen um and and let's embrace it let's let's embrace the suffering let's embrace the trials let's embrace our shortcomings so that we can be more and more like Jesus and that's how we're going to grow you know I want our church to grow numerically but I also want to grow spiritually you know this is this is a unique time in the church it really is and what are we going to be you know are we going to be the church that you know luk L dies off come on it's up to us it's up to you are you going to be on fire for God this week amen and so I just want to encourage you you know if you have no problem doing Bible studies and you're in 10 Bible studies find somebody around you that's not and and get them to Le a Bible study let let's make let's make it contagious this this spreading of of the word of God Amen um and and do what you can you know some of us are on campus you know and and share with 100 people do that some of us have have some kids and and to go out to Walmart and share with a couple like that's a big do that do what you can do uh and and so I know that that when we apply these things when we look at God's perfect rule for our lives it is through the perfect law that we find Freedom and it is through the perfect love that Jesus showed us that we become perfect that when we when we embrace the life that Jesus live okay I'm going to live that life you know Christianity choice you don't have to be a chran but if you Cho to be a Christian be a Christian amen God",

    "transcript": "Amen. Well, good afternoon everybody. Please turn your Bibles to Psalm chapter 34. Let's get right into it. You know, this past week, I was thinking about something and I was talking with another brother as well, and we're we're thinking about as we're conversing in our uh discipling time is what actually changes a person like what actually can help someone to change? What how can we not only look in other people but even in oursel of what gets a person to actually change? What gets a person to actually repent? What what helps somebody actually see their sins? Is it us? Certainly not us. You know, there's nothing that we could do. But then what is it like? Is it is it them? Is it something that we could help them with? And I was thinking a lot about this as this brother and I were talking and it it really got me to think even deeply for myself like what helps me to change like h how can I as a disciple cuz just because I become a disciple it doesn't mean I no longer need change so what helps me to change if I want to help others I have to help myself Psalm 34 this will be the core passage for us today and says in verse 18 the Lord is near the broken hearted. He saves those crushed in spirits. You know, one thing that stands out person to person is how broken they are. You know, people can have the same circumstances. They can be given the same lives, but not every person is broken. Not every person sees their how much they've been crushed by their sins, how much the world needs help, how much they need help. And the word broken, it literally means crushed. Like this word is used over 200 times in the Old Testaments and only two or three times it's referring to a person. is constantly referred to a destroying of a wall, destroying of a nation, like the breaking of, you know, an army and how God like just snaps like it all in half and just totally shatters it. But then here it talks about the heart, a completely shattered heart, a broken heart before God. It says there that God saves those who are brokenhearted and those who are crushed in spirit. Today we're going to talk about brokenness. Let's go to Luke chapter 15. All right. And in uh this this search for brokenness, I want us to kind of think about what what is brokenness if we were to think about it right now. Like right now, you know, sometimes we might think brokenness is when someone feels a lot of emotion towards something and there's a level of guilt in there. Sometimes brokenness is just overall regret. Maybe they feel regrets. But we're going to look at the Bible's example of great brokenness. In Luke 15, it says in verse 11, we're going to read a big chunk here. It says, \"He also said, a man had two sons. The younger of them uh said to his father, \"Father, give me uh the share of this estate um I have coming to me.\" So he distributed the assets to them. Not many days later, the younger son gathered together all he had and traveled to a distant country where he squandered his estate in foolish living. After he had spent everything, uh, a severe famine struck that country and he had nothing. Then he went to work for one of the citizens of that country who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. He longed to eat his fill from the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one would give him anything. When he came to his senses, he said, \"How many of my father's hired workers have more than enough food, and here I am dying of hunger? I'll get up, go to my father, and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired workers.\" So he got up and went to his father. But while the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. The son said to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.\" But the father told his servants, \"Quick, bring out the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Then bring the fattened calf and slaughter it and let celebrate with the feast because this son of mine was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found.\" So they began to celebrate. See, this parable that Jesus gives is first of all a really great image that Jesus gives us of what happens when we decide to come back to God after leaving our life of sin. How wide open his arms are for you. How quick he is to welcome you. Just you coming towards him makes him want to finish the rest and come meet you in the middle. And it's really a beautiful story. But before then, let's kind of look at what the son had to experience. First, he goes to his father and says, \"Give me what belongs to me. Give me my inheritance.\" And he takes his inheritance. And what he he does what most of us do. We distance oursel from God. It says that he went to a distant country. Here's what happens. We God has given us the ability to think, the ability to think for ourselves, the ability to make money for ourselves, to support ourselves, but we use that and we actually separate ourselves, distance oursel from God. God gave it to you, but we use it and we distance oursel from him with what he's given us. We are just like this son. We we at at at some point all of us have distanced oursel from God. And it says what he does after a famine strikes the land. It says that you know he has first he loses his money then a famine strikes the land and then he goes to work for someone in that foreign country. And here's the situation. He literally works for them and he feeds their pigs. And it says he longed to eat his fill from the pods. What does this tell us? It literally means he went to work for them, but he didn't even get enough to feed himself. He was literally working for nothing. He saw the food that he was giving the pigs. I want to eat that. I need my fill. So what happens is we literally distance oursel from God. We leave God. We we we we take you know our our our way of pleasure, our way of comfort, our way of pride, our way of selfishness and we distance oursel from God and we end up working not for God but for someone to for ourselves, for Satan, for something other than God. But just like this young man, it's all work for nothing. We get nothing for it. Nothing from it. No benefit. And we're still in hunger. Come on. We're still longing. And this is the part where it talks about brokenness. In verse 17, it says he came to his senses. He came to his senses. It in the Greek is ace umu de uh eromi and it literally means he arrived to himself. Wow. He took this journey where he separated himself from God, squandered his wealth, squandered what God had given him and at the very end he discovered himself. Wow. That is brokenness. I is the idea is that you see who you are truly without God. You you you examine yourself like I am nothing. I am a squander of what God has given me. All I have are selfish desires. And even when I act out on these desires, I am left totally hungry, totally helpless. And I am nothing before God. That is brokenness. And it is literally according to the Bible coming to your senses. You arrive at yourself because life is a journey. And it's the idea is that when you're going on this journey and you find out who you are without God at the end of the journey and the idea is that brokenness is the final destination of this journey. You know, you you distance yourself from God. I think in common terms, it's like you get on the light rail and you're trying to go across the United States. You want to go as far as humanly possible. You you you want to see how can you live if you tried it your way. How can you live if you pursued your desires? How could you live if you were in control? How could you live if you lived according to every desire and inclination of your heart and minds? And then if you actually go this way and just like the the father here, he let the son go that way. He literally gave it to me. Go ahead, go. But so he could finally discover himself. So if you take that light row, this journey, this life at the end of the destination, if you actually arrive at the destination God wants you to arrive at brokenness, come on, coming to your senses, it's like he meets you there and he's like, \"I'm so glad you arrived where I wanted you to arrive. You got to where I wanted you to be.\" And so he takes you the rest of the way. He meets you halfway there. And since life is a journey and destination the destination is brokenness, we have to be careful that we arrive at the right destination. What happens is we can easily we see it we go through life and we can arrive at the wrong destination. And what that is it is the wrong conclusion to our life of suffering. The wrong conclusion to how we've undergone and dealt with our own sin. how we look at the suffering world around us and we arrive at the wrong conclusion that it's maybe someone else's fault. You know, maybe what happens is he squandered his wealth, his own choice, and then a famine came upon him and it made it worse. But you don't see him saying, \"If only this famine didn't happen, then I wouldn't be in this situation.\" He is not blaming anyone but himself. That is brokenness. that even if and under true circumstances, you actually have been wronged and you have been uh literally victimized and there you have no control. And and I'm sure many of us know what that's like to literally actually be victims to circumstance. But God wants us to overcome it and only see what we could do differently. It says in Isaiah, the fruit of righteousness is peace. What does this tell us? that we can have peace based off of what we do, not what is done around us. And think of this. Think of Joseph. Joseph, you know, in the Bible in Genesis chapter 40, he was beaten by his brothers. He had a dream that God gave to him and he was beaten for it and then cast in a in a hole in the ground. And his brothers thought, \"We'll just come back and we'll kill him later.\" But luckily, one brother stood up said, \"No, let's let's not do that. let's let's do it just a little bit less. Let's sell him into slavery. So, he gets literally sold into slavery and he still does his best. He still is trying his best, but then he gets accused of assaulting his master's wife. And then he gets put into prison. And at this point, I'm sure it's like, \"My family has forgotten me. My brothers hate me. They do they even know that I'm alive?\" And now he's in prison. And he's trying to get, you know, his inmates to, you know, when they get out to tell Pharaoh that, hey, you know, someone come get me. I've just been rotting in here. And then even that inmate forgets about him. Literally constantly forgotten, constantly abandoned. And then when he finally gets out and he finally meets his brothers, he has nothing but tears of joy. Nothing but tears of joy, seeing that they're alive. And he literally says, \"What you intended for evil, God meant for my good.\" He found peace regardless of the sin that was against him. Think of David. David when he was running from Saul and literally David had the whole kingdom of Israel against him. He had a few men with him, but the whole army was against him. And he could have justified, you know, I he at this point has been anointed. He could have easily tooken the kingship. He could have easily taken the throne. But he said, \"You know what? I'm not going to kill the person that's hunting for my life. I am not going to kill the person that wants me dead for no reason.\" And he could have had every excuse to throw a tantrum. He had chances. Even his own men told him to kill Saul. But he didn't. He He wasn't going to allow himself to get to a point to where he sins. And because that's on him and he could have said, \"Well, if I kill if I kill Saul, like it's justified, right? Like he's trying to kill me.\" But no, I'm not going to sin regardless of what he's doing against me. Amen. And so he waited and he waited and he waited. And of course, we have even Jesus's example. You know, he was humiliated, violated, embarrassed, literally stripped naked in front of a whole cohort of soldiers, and then beaten, abused, and mocked. And then after he's beaten, abused, and mocked, and he's bleeding, they put his robes right back on him. And then he's on the verge of death, and they have him carry a 100 pounds of wood. And God in the flesh wasn't able to carry it and they had to get someone else to carry it. And yet when he's on the cross still he says, \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.\" Constantly time and time again we see this example of true brokenness only looks to self. True brokenness is literally your conclusion is that if I could only do what is right, then I could be at peace. If I if only I could do what is right. If only I could realize who I truly am. That is all I need to be at peace with God. That is brokenness. Brokenness is not just seeing your need for God that leads to repentance, but it's continuing to see your need for God even if no one around you is repenting. and you continue to desire it more and more and more regardless if no one around you is changing, if no one around you is repenting. And if if anything, your desire for God only grows. You know, for me, this past uh 12 months, I would say, has have been the the highest points of my disciplehip while simultaneously probably some of the lowest points of my disciplehip. Um, you know, every I remember this one brother did a lesson and he talked about some of the main fears that people have and not typical phobias like arachnophobia or claustrophobia but you know other deep embedded fears that we have things like the fear of not accomplishing anything like the fears of the fear of being alone the fear of being unwanted and he even sent an article and I've tried to find this article I could never find it again. It just brings up scared of spiders every time. I think you know Google thinks I'm scared of spiders maybe. But I but the idea is um one of the topics that he did I resonated the mo with the most with it was the fear of being useless. The idea that I could be in someone's life and provide no help for them, no benefit for them. And if anything like my presence, me being there or not being there has the same effect for this person. And as he was preaching on it, I'm like, that's a deep fear of mine. Like the thought that I can try my best to be there for somebody, to help somebody, and it means absolutely nothing. It it might as well be as if I I wasn't there at all. And this fear was coming up a lot for me uh the past 12 months. Even the idea of being a father, can I be useful as a father, you know, being a young dad, c can I really do it? Be being a husband, can I really do it? Can I be a great husband at at my age? uh thinking uh can I even help my am I useful for myself? Can I help myself? Can I even change? Can I grow the way that I want to grow? I feel like I'm not growing in the way that I want to grow sometimes, you know? And this idea of just constantly feeling like am I a failure at everything that I do? Like can I really amount to the youth I want to actually help people with? And it kept coming up and it kept coming up and e even thinking like is is life even worth living if I can't help anybody like if I provide zero use for the people around me like then what's the point and sadly in these thoughts sometimes I would even think that if only different things in my life would change like different maybe if my financial circumstance was different we were living in Miami third most expensive city in the US and I'm like you know what maybe if you know the the the my car note wasn't so high. You know, maybe if the insurance wasn't so high, if my rent wasn't so high. We moved here. We have more bedrooms and we pay less rent than we did in Miami. It's crazy. We didn't we didn't we literally technically downgraded, but we upgra upgraded, funny enough, and it's really incredible. But and I was like, if only my maybe my financial situation would change. You know, there was uh even in our ministry, there was secret sin happening. There was a time, you know, uh a young brother confessed, you know, basically hiding immorality for a few months and then I was like I was totally blind. Like if I didn't see it, how can I help anybody? And I remember feeling those different thoughts. But then I I realized something is that even if thing by thing and ch and all these different things different and they all changed even if they if one by one or all of them changed I would still struggle with the same thoughts because at the end of the day I'm not dealing with those things I'm dealing with myself at the end of the day even if I if I'm put in the same situation I am still Malik I am still the same exact exact person. So I have to figure out no matter where I'm at, how can I be completely at peace? And the answer is just brokenness. What happened was I was just looking to my circumstance. Come on, bro. I was looking to that to events around me. And I wasn't at peace because I wasn't broken. And for me to be broken, I have to arrive at myself. Come on, bro. The final destination has to be myself. Let's go to Luke 18. And so if the final destination is myself, then I have to do a pretty darn good job at examining myself. I have to really see where I'm at. And I have to not lie to myself. I have to not deceive myself. I have to truly see who I am without God. Come on. Without even the slightest bit of self-exalting myself. Come on. In Luke 18, it says in verse 9, uh, he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else. Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee, the other a tax collector. The Pharisee was standing and praying uh like this about himself. God, I thank you that I'm not like other people, greedy, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week. I give a tenth of everything I get. But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even raise his eyes to heaven, but kept striking his chest and saying, \"God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\" I tell you, this one went down to his house justified rather than the other. Because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted. See, this passage is so incredible when you compare the two people. The Pharisee literally it says he went to the temple to pray and that he was standing and praying about himself and he names how righteous he is. He ra he names how not greedy he is. And it's amazing. He literally says, \"I give a tenth of all that I have.\" Um, and then he also, I fast twice a week. So, he he's so bent on talking about his accomplishments. He is so bent on talking about his righteous deeds. Even though these are in the Bible, not being adulterer, not being greedy is in the Bible. There are things that God wants us to do. But he thought that that was himself. He viewed himself as that way. But the tax collector, that is not how he viewed himself. He viewed himself as a sinner. He truly saw who he was without God. And here's what happens is when you're not truly broken, you view righteous acts as a way to cover up your unbrokeness. So if brokenness is getting to the center of who you are, like peeling away layers of an onion and finding out who you really are at your core without God. The opposite is adding layers, covering up who you are truly on the inside. And you do it not just by sinning, but you literally do it by pretending to be more righteous than you actually are. And I I love even what Ian was sharing. It says, \"What does God require of you?\" You know, to to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. And so it's not about we we focus on the righteous deeds, but the righteous deeds mean nothing if you're not broken because you don't know who you are without God. And so it's so important that we actually get to the root of who we are. And it doesn't matter because if you're not broken by your righteous deeds, you know, God says if you don't if you exalt yourself, you will be humbled. If you're not broken by what you do and you try to cover up with righteous deeds, it's like God does the opposite. He breaks you. He He does. If you don't humble yourself, he humbles you. That's right. But when you're actually humble, when you actually get to who you are, then God lifts you up. Then you can actually do what he wants you to do in a very sincere manner, in a genuine manner. And I really only have uh one point for you guys. It's uh don't be entitled. Entitlements will be the the enemy of brokenness. And let's go back to where we were in the in the parable Luke 15. because there are two sons and let's see the reaction of the other son. Let's see what he did in Luke 15:2. It says, \"Now his older son was in the field. As he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he summoned one of the servants questioning what uh questioning what these things meant.\" Uh, your brother is here, he told him. And your father has slaughtered the fattening calf because he has come back safe and sound. Then he became angry and didn't want to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him. But he replied to his father, \"Look, I have been slaving many years for you and have never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me a goat uh so that I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has devoured your assets with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him. Son, he said to him, you are always with me and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again. He is lost and he is found. See, entitlement is when you believe you are worth more than what you are and therefore you believe you are more deserving of a different status and a higher reward rather than what you're currently being given. And it's like, you know, think of it like three levels, right? One version of entitlement is let's say you have slave, you have son, and let's say you have prince. Right? The idea is that one version of entitlement is you're a son and you believe you should be treated like a prince. You should be treated a level higher than what you're at. This wasn't exactly his version of entitlement. Notice how it says in uh it says in verse u 29 that he is slaving away. So it wasn't that he viewed himself as a son but believed he deserved the treatment of a prince but he was a son but he viewed himself as a slave. And what it was was he showed contempt for being actually regarded as a son. And God literally said, \"All that I have is yours.\" But what happened was he viewed his title as sunship as being a slave. So what does this look like for us in today's day and age? Literally right now, we can view disciplehip as burdensome. And it's not like, well, I'm a disciple and I could be getting more blessings. It's like, no, I haven't even reached the basic level of blessings. I am literally living in a way worse life that I could be living if I wasn't a disciple. Very different. It's literally like you literally view the blessings that God is trying to give you with contempt. Come on, bro. You have become entitled. And let's go to Malachi chapter 1. Let's see what the Bible says about contempt because we uh we can't be entitled. Amen. That's right. Amen. It says in Malachi 1 verse 6, uh we're going to read another big chunk here. It says, \"A son honors his father and the servant his master. But if I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is your fear of me, says the Lord of armies, to you priests who despise my name?\" Okay, so the Israelites, quick context, they came out of exile of for 70 years and it was punishment for their wicked sin. However, God didn't want them just to only be punished. He wanted them to learn from it and come back to come back to the lands and build his temple and and actually give glory to him once again. But the issue was that, you know, they weren't treating him with honor. They they weren't treating him with honor the way a son honors a father or the way a slave honors their master. And so God is speaking through Malachi and it's very similar to even Haggi how he says, \"Why do you live in panled houses while the Lord's house lies in ruins?\" And the idea was they came back from exile and they were super entitled. I imagine what that's like. Like imagine you know you're you're you get you get punished but your parents love you so much they don't want you to ultimately be punished once you learn from your mistake then like you know you can have ice cream and what's amazing is that like okay I know my parents love me but when you're entitled you treat that reward with contempt and so the Israelites their issue was they viewed their title as being sons and daughters of God with complete contempt. that they deserved it. And so because they deserved it, let's see what they did. Because they believe they deserved it, let's see what they did. It says, \"Yet you ask, how have we despised your name?\" Verse 7, \"By presenting defiled food on my altar.\" You have h how have we defiled you? You asked. When you say, \"The Lord's table is contemptable.\" When you present a blind animal for your sacrifice, is it not wrong? When you present a lame or sick animal, is it not wrong? Bring it to your governor. Would he be pleased with you or show your or or show you favor? Ask the Lord of armies. And now plead for God's favor. Will he be gracious to us? Since this has come from your hands, will he show any of you favor? asked the Lord of armies. I wish one of you would shut the temple doors so that you would no longer kindle a useless fire on my altar. I am not pleased with you, says the Lord of armies, and I will accept no offering from your hands. My name will be great among the nations from the rising of the sun to its setting. Incense and pure offering will be presented in my name in every place because my name will be great among the nations, says the Lord of armies. But you are profaining it when you say the Lord's table is defiled and its produce, its food is contemptable. You also say, \"Look, what a nuisance.\" And you scorn it, says the Lord of armies. You bring stolen, lame, or sick animals. You bring this as an offering. Am I to accept that from your hands? asks the Lord. This was their situation. When they came back, they believed and they were so entitled as believing that they were God's chosen people that they could offer any kind of sacrifice that they wanted. And God views when you don't give your best as contempt. Come on. And just like the sun, what happens is we become entitled. We believe that we should be getting more than what we're worth. And what and when you choose not to give God your best, you are treating being a child of God with contempt. You are treating being a disciple of Jesus with entitlement because you think you're deserving somehow of what you have. and that if anything, you've been a complete slave and that you're not an unworthy slave, but a worthy of more. You believe you're worthy of more honor, of more celebration. Come on. But that's not the case. See, when you show contempt when you stop giving your best. Come on, bro. You show you're entitled when you stop giving your best. And God says literally in verse 10 that he prefers there to be no sacrifices at all. like it's literally give your best or don't give at all. That is how God views it. And I I believe it's super important for us how we view God in the way that he wants us to view him. And literally, he says, \"I wish one of you, just one of you, would have the indignation to shut the temple doors cuz I'm tired of seeing offerings that are with sick animals. With crippled animals, I want the best.\" Amen. Because if my name is to be great, you have to treat it with absolute greatness. And you cannot treat it with greatness if you don't give your best. And that's what happens. You're literally saying the Lord's table is contemptable. Is literally you're saying, \"Oh, like you know, God accepts, you know, not me not giving my best. God accepts the lame and the sick animals that I can give as an offering.\" and you literally treat not just him with contempt, but you literally believe that it's totally okay. And you make all the excuses in the world not to give your best. Why is this so dangerous? That is the opposite of a broken heart. It is the opposite of being broken. Because entitlement uh is being contempt because you're showing disdain towards being a child of God. Being broken is you're doing whatever it takes not only to be a child of God, but to stay a child of God. And you don't treat it with entitlements. And here's the re the re the real issue. If you're not giving your best, it's because you're not broken. If you're not giving 100%, you just haven't been broken yet. And I love seeing the disciples walk with Jesus because they had to realize time and time again who Jesus really was. And so even if you've been broken once, you've been broken twice, you can still be broken again. You have to continue to realize who you are without God. Let's close out in Luke chapter 5. Luke chapter 5 in verse 31. Let's see what Jesus says. It says, Jesus replied to them, it is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. See, Jesus came to find those who are sick. Jesus came to find those who are brokenhearted, to find those who have a broken and contrite spirits. He came to those who need and seek for help time and time again. But if you believe you're healthy and you believe you're okay and if you believe that you've done enough righteous things where you're now deserving and you don't no you no longer need a doctor. It literally says that he has not come to call you. He has come to call the sick. He has come to those who need him. Come on to those who desire him. And we are not deserving of his calling of us. We are not worthy of his calling of us. It's only because we realize who we are without him that he desires you to be with him. So if you're sick and if you're in need of healing, you're exactly where God wants you to be cuz you realize who you are without him. If if you're broken, if you're crushed in your spirit, then you've arrived at your final destination. You have come to the place where God can finally take you the rest of the way there. You're exactly where he wants you to be. So don't be entitled. Don't be contemptuous. But be broken with who you are without God. See your desire for God. And you will need to keep that desire. Keep that brokenness day after day after day, time after time. Even at if life gets better, you still have to be broken. That's right. If life gets worse, you still have to be broken. No matter what comes your way, you must be broken before God. To God be all the glory. And I really only have uh one point for you guys. It's uh don't be entitled. Entitlements will be the the enemy of brokenness. And let's go back to where we were in the in the parable. Luke 15 because there are two sons and let's see the reaction of the other son. Let's see what he did. In Luke 15:2 it says, \"Now his older son was in the field. As he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.

ready and we had a system where the first thing we did we were giving out food right um and we were packing cantaloup and there's two people beside me and I'm literally they have a bag open I'm just putting cantaloupes in their bag and they wrap it and they give it to two people and the whole time we're going like this and we finished like 20 minutes faster than they ever thought we would cuz how fast we were just packing cantaloupes and then we did it with sweet potatoes and then when they came the the lady said that they've never seen such an efficient assembly line of giving out the food and to the point to where not just the lady wanted us to come back but we did it at a a community center and the community center host said you guys did it so amazingly so fast that he gave us the contact for when they host just a larger event because they thought is so very efficient they wanted us to come back so um but it's amazing because like I was saying we gathered together as disciples and as disciples do we just want to make it great and so even Gathering right now do you guys want to make this Sunday service Grace it really requires one thing giving your hearts just giving your hearts it is not even about can you yell the loudest can you you know be the most wellknown in the room is can you give your hearts in this moment because if you can't do it right now when people are inspiring you pushing you to do it together how can you do it when no one's RS and so it's not that we do it for other people but we get the inspiration to do it even when other people aren't there and so last week we even talked about Brokenness and how God God the idea of Brokenness is realizing who you are without God and why is that so important is because if we want to give our best to God we have to know who we are without him because we want to come to him with everything that we haven't been giving him when we are choosing not to follow him and we're going to use today's lesson to kind of go off of that but same thing I want us all today to give our hearts and it's going to be really good uh let's go to John chapter and I'm actually going to continue a little bit off of that last lesson because Brokenness is so important being broken before God realizing who you are without God is of the utmost importance of being with him day after day year after year for the rest of your lives and alongside that is this scripture that uh that comes that came to mind even as I was doing last week's lesson uh my title for you guys is do you want to get well cuz even if you're broken if you don't want to get well it means nothing if you realize who you are with God that is without God that is not the end points you still have to want to get better you can see that you need him you can see that you're desperate and you're nothing without him but you also then have the desire to be with him there are so many people that have had have reached that point of nothingness being empty being poured out or being poured out by someone else being left a victim to whoever is around them being abused taken advantage of or they themselves have faced the consequences of their poor decisions and they're left with nothing but they haven't been able to answer this question do they want to get well In this passage John chapter 5 it says in verse one after this a Jewish Festival took place and Jesus went up to Jerusalem by the Sheep gate in Jerusalem there was a pool called Bethesda in Aramaic which has five colonades with these lay a large number of the disabled blind lame and paralyzed okay one thing that's fascinating about Jesus's character is while there's a festival happening and all the Jewish people are having festivities it's excitement it's at the celebration Jesus is by the Sheep Gat where there's the disabled the paralyzed and the lame it's kind of interesting to think about like literally while everyone's having fun here is Jesus around the helpless let's keep reading says one man was there who had been disabled for 38 years when Jesus saw him lying there and realized he had already been there a long time he said said to him do you want to get well Jesus leaves the situation while everyone is celebrating everyone is enjoying their time together with their families he's around people who have no one to help them and then he sees a particular man and it literally says that he realized that he's been there a very long time what is so important before Jesus asks do you want want to get well he recognizes where you're at he sees your condition he sees how long you've been there and there have been many people in the Bible to where they're calling out to Jesus saying Lord son of David the Messiah please help me but this man is different Jesus notices him he sees him before he was ever looking for help and he knows his condition do you know your condition do you know the condition that you are in right now do you know the condition of the world you know one time when we're in India you know we're at a park and we're having a bible discussion in this park and I remember seeing these kids the same age as the kids that are going into Kids Kingdom about yayi and I see them chewing tobacco and smoking cigarettes and one thing that was told to us coming into India was that we are trying to start up different schools and obviously it costs money but trying to raise up these different schools cuz what the biggest preventor that keeps these kids from going on drugs at nine years old 10 years old is education and I remember seeing it for the first time little children eight nine years old really small and because it's a in India they're a bit smaller so even though they're eight or nine maybe here an eight and nine-year-old is here but here like an eight and niney old is like this tall they're small and you're seeing them like with their teeth rotted because of how early they started chewing tobacco how early they started smoking cigarettes and that is what I saw and I'm sure some of you guys sitting here have seen a lot worse things have seen terrible things happen to those in the condition that the world is in right now and you know some of the things that people do when they're craving attention when they're craving pleasure when they're craving having some sort of emotional need met when they're looking for something to feel something they're looking for happiness they're looking for adrenaline the things that people do and you look at the condition of the world the thing that comes to mind is deprivation that the world is in a state of complete deprivation and it's important for us even sitting here to realize that we have that same desire that that that same emptiness of constantly trying to fill it with all of these other things that are not God looking for an answer looking for a way looking for something to give us some sense of satisfaction some sense of Joy some sense of feeling but it's not God it's not him and the reason you know why deprivation deprivation it literally means a lack of a necessity and the idea is that you're not being deprived of your wants of what you could have is you're being deprived of a basic human necessity deprivation and it leads to depravity depravity means corrupt moral character so what happens is from uh a young age or whatever age even your own decision you have a lack of basic human necessity and it leads you to a corrupt moral character and the thing that we all lack at our core is God we have a sinful nature Romans chapter 3 it says there is no one who seeks God and it's not saying we can't seek God it's saying naturally we don't naturally we don't want to in our very nature we're not looking for God we're looking for something else we are all deprived every single one of us and it leads us to to De gravity a a corrupt moral character and because we have this state of deprivation we have to realize that what we need is God imagine this like depravity is deprivation is this bottomless pit and you're trying to fill this bottomless pit hoping that somehow some way it'll be filled it'll come to the top and you no longer have to fill it you've reached all your needs you've you've uh fulfilled all your desires all your sins you've got all your wealth all your influence everything you could ever want and you're hoping that someday this bottomless pit is filled with everything that you want but it never is the only way you can fill a bottomless immeasurable pit is an infinite God it is the only way the the the human heart is designed to be filled with God and we know that because of deprivation the idea of us constantly wanting more the idea of us constantly wanting more points to the need of God the only way you can be completely satisfied when it's no longer what you want but what you need and the only thing you need the only one you need is God and so when you try to fill up all these other things it never works it never works and Jesus in this situation looks at the paralyzed man after 30 eight years and just asks him do you want to get well and I find that we have to face that question each and every single day do we actually want to get well you would think that of course he wants to get well he's literally sitting there paralyzed for 38 years but he still ask you do you want to get well it's almost like you're trying to fill this pit and he's like I have a solution do you want do you want to try the solution but he's waiting to see your willingness do you want to get well you see he was there for 38 years and the reason why 38 is super significant is because the Israelites wandered in the desert exactly 38 years in Deuteronomy chapter 2 ver14 I believe we you know we round it to 40 but the Bible explicitly says 38 why were they in the desert for 38 years when it was an 11-day Journey it was because of the Rebellion towards God it was because of of their lack of reverence towards God and they stopped focusing on God and they focused on man focus on their themselves and focus on all their problems and so an 11 day Journey took 38 years because God said I will not allow any of these rebellious people this rebellious generation to enter the promised lands their children will go in after them or go go in before them and they won't answer and the idea of 38 years and then finally reaching the promised land when all that wickedness is gone is the symbolism that you see in this passage there's no coincidences there is a reason why Jesus met this man 38 years later is finally him reaching out his hand and saying do you want to enter the promised lands do you want to get well which is the question that we're all faced today and I think that we have to before we answer that question we have to actually ask ourself what do we want what do we actually want because whenever we do all these other things it's proof that we're wanting something else like the the the Greek word for to be healed the same way do you want to get well is soo and it's the same word used for salvation do you want to be saved so the idea of do you want to be well do you want to be healed do you want to be saved the question lies on you do you actually wanted so we have to ask ourselves what do we want then and there's a man in the Bible that we're going to do a little case study on who we all look up to constantly we all look in the Bible he's a man after God's Own Heart but even after going after God's Own Heart even he was faced with this question what does he actually want let's go to 1st Samuel chapter 7 hope you guys are with me oh sorry 2 Samuel 7 sorry 2 Samuel chapter 7 well we're we're going to look at two things we're going to look at David's relationship with God how it started or in the beginning and then we're going to look at it at his lowest points so let's look at how it how it was in the beginning in 2 Samuel 7 and verse 8 this is God speaking through one of his prophets to David says so now this is what you are to say to my servant David this is what the lord of army says I took you from the pasture from tending the flock to be ruler Over My People Israel I have been with you wherever you have gone and I have destroyed all your enemies before you I will make a great name for you like that of the greatest on Earth I will designate a place for My People Israel and plant them so that they may live there and not be disturbed again evildoers will not continue to oppress them as they have done ever since the day I uh ordered judges to be over My People Israel I will give you rest from all your enemies the Lord declares to you the Lord himself will make a house for you okay does this not sound like the best relationship with God you could ever ask for literally he's like well I can build you a house God but he said no I will build you a house David like literally imagine that like all the great things you want to do for God says no no I'm going to do great things for you like that is like the most amazing relationship with God that we could ever ask for and even more so he literally says I took you from being a Shepherd boy to a King to a ruler over all of my people and they will no longer have enemies coming after them and they will be safe because of you I'm going to be working through you David to lead my people to peace and he literally says at the very end too that I will give you rest from all your enemies imagine that like does that not sound like the best relationship with God you could ever ask for and it gets better the L get better in verse 12 it says when your time comes and you rest with your ancestors I will raise up after you your descendant who will come from your body and will establish his kingdom he is the one who will build a house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever I will be his father and he will be my son when he does wrong I will discipline him with a rod of men and blows from Mortals but my faithful love will never leave him as it did when I removed it from Saul whom I removed from before you your house and Kingdom will endure before me forever and your throne will be established forever Nathan reported all these words and his entire Vision to David so it literally got better it extended Beyond just David but it went to his descendants uh imagine that where God said I will never leave leave your family line I will never leave your son the way I did with Saul like literally when Saul was repeatedly Wicked God justed the spirit just left him but God said I will not leave your son even if he does wrong like isn't that for anyone who has children imagine that God saying I will always be with your child no matter how much wrong that they do like that is the most a parent could ever ask for and this is David's response in verse 18 then King David went in sat in the Lord's presence and said who am I Lord God and what is my house that you have brought me this far what you have done so far was a little thing to you Lord God for you have also spoken about your uh servant's house in the distant future and this is a revelation for mankind Lord God what more can David say to you you know your servant Lord God because of your word and according to your will H you have revealed all these things to your servant so you see in the beginning of David's relationship with God he took it with full humility says who am I I am undeserving of this why should I have such great blessings why should I be given so much from you and the beginning of David's relationship with God you get that idea of what talked about Revelation the first love the idea of when you are with God and you're with God purely and solely for him and you can see in this moment that what David wanted was God and everything God gave him was extra I just wanted you God there's nothing more so there's nothing more that I want and for us what do we want is it truly God or is it what he's giving to us are we in this relationship with God because of what he's giving or is what he giving already extra is being a disciple extra is helping other people extra is having daily quiet times fellowshipping confessing your sins is that extra or is that simply an expectation from God see when you truly want God everything else is just extra but let's see what David's relationship looked like with God later a few chapters later chapter 12 2 Samuel 12 says in verse one so as the the worst thing that David ever did was he he committed adultery and it said that he did it at a time when kings go off the war and it said he was standing at the top of his Palace looking down so you get the sense that he lost his humility and he now stands at the top of his people while his army and his commanders are off that war there he is looking down on his people and this this is what happens after he commits adultery it says so the Lord sent Nathan to David when he arrived he said to him there were two men in a certain city one rich the other poor the rich man had very large flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing except one small U lamb that he had bought he raised her and she grew up with him and with his children from his meager food she would eat from his cup she would drink and in his arms she would sleep she was like a daughter to him now a traveler came to the rich man but the rich man could not bring himself to take one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare for the traveler who had come to him instead he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for his guest David was infuriated with the man uh and said to Nathan as the Lord lives the man who did this deserves to die because he has done this thing and shown no pity he must pay four Lambs for that lamb Nathan replied to David you are that man this is what the Lord God of Israel says I anointed you King over Israel I rescued you from Saul I gave your Master's house to you and your Master's wives to in your arms and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah and if that wasn't enough I would have given you even more why then have you despised the Lord's command by doing what I consider evil you struck down Uriah the heite with the sword and took his wife as your own wife you murdered him with the ammonite sword now therefore the sword will never leave your house because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the heite to be your own wife so David the man we look up to after God's Own Hearts when he hit his absolute low you get this sense that he lost his humility he he lost his deep longing and desire for God In This Moment and he wanted something else and sadly he wanted someone else and it wasn't God and he literally killed a husband for the sake of having his wife and so when Nathan confronts him he's like do you not see what you have done even you view it wickedly and so when he confronts him it's really amazing God's like I gave you this I gave you the kingdom I gave you your your enemy saw the previous King who wanted nothing but the hunt your life I gave you everything that was his I decided to build you a house I gave you rest from your enemies and yet if this wasn't enough for you I would have given you even more like God wants to give us even more but what we do is we despise him you know sin is interesting and the flesh you know I believe that the flesh is the part of us that doesn't want God and when we act on the flesh we're simply acting out those desires that aren't wanting God we want something else we we want to be in in our own pity party per se you know pity pity part is interesting it seems like a bad being sad seems like a bad thing but it's called the pity party because you like being there you like being in your own bag and the reality is that even things that we know aren't good for us we still want them our sins whether it be lashing out at anger whether it be wanting to control people wanting people to listen to you wanting influence wealth power wanting pleasure all these different things we these are things that we want that are not God so we act on our flesh because that is the part of us that doesn't actually want him do you know what you truly want because deep down we're all deprived we're all left wanting we're all left unsatisfied trying to fill up fill up this bottomless hole with things that are not God but you need an infinite God to fill up that hole and so if we're all deprived and just like David any single one of us gives into this desire gives into this deprivation of something that simply isn't God wanting something that is not God then how can we actually be at peace with God if at our core we don't want him then how can we actually be at peace with him how can we actually have a mind have a soul that actually desires him and desires him truthfully let's go to Isaiah chapter 26 because there is an answer but for us to find that answer we have to realize how much we need God we have to realize how much we have to deeply long and desire for him in Isaiah chap 26 it says says in verse I'm in Proverbs Isaiah chap 26 it says in verse uh 3 you will keep the mind that is dependent on you in perfect peace for it is trusting in you talking about God trust in the Lord forever because in the Lord the Lord himself is an everlasting Rock see you know the csb says you will keep the mind that is dependent on you the NIV or nasb says the mind that is steadfast right and the word steadfast the Hebrew word uh it it says uh Sak and it means to lay on it literally means to rest like to to lean on you know the proverb uh uh uh trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding is instead you're supposed to be leaning on God you rest on God and the idea is this is the mind that rests on God will be at peace think of the Apostles all that they had to endure all the persecutions all the suffering think of it says that Jesus for the joy set before him endured the cross how was he able to endure such hardship is because his mind was somewhere else it was resting on God he was able to go through anything in everything overcome any Temptation it says that he was tempted in every single way but he was perfect perfect through his obedience and so for us how can we be just like that how can we have a mind that rests on God it is to rely on him to Simply take refuge in God and it says that then we will be at peace our minds will be stilled God when he finally looks at you and says do you want to get well you actually know how to do that I need to put my mind at rest in him let's go back to John 5 let's see how we can do this more practically hope you guys are with me in John chapter 5 it says if we continue where we were after Jesus asked do you want to get well he says sir the dis the the disabled man answered I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up but while I'm coming someone goes down down ahead of me here was his answer when Jesus asked him do you want to get well he said I have no one and that goes back to that deprivation we need relationships we need people in our lives and here's this man saying I have no one there is no one there for me and Jesus doesn't even reassure him he doesn't even say well I'll help you I I'll get you into the pool he doesn't even like in any semblance give him any response to his answer to his question but he says instead in verse 8 get up Jesus told him pick up your mat and walk instantly the man got well picked up his mat and started to walk second point for us today is get up pick up your mat and walk and it's quite incredible because when he said I had no one to help me to get into that pool he believed that the answer to his healing was in that pool he and that's what we do very constantly we believe the answer to our issues is somewhere other than Christ the answer to our problems the answer to being healed is somewhere other than God but Jesus comes to him and not only says do you want to get well but he gives him the answer he says to get up and at this moment is actually very fascinating we learn that what kept Him from getting well was not knowing Jesus he was kept paralyzed all those years and he never got healing because he never met Jesus yet so the answer is not just him meeting Jesus but this whole interaction so what happened was when he says do you want to get well he says a whole excuse and then Jesus says get up pick up your mat and walk so it wasn't just seeing Jesus and meeting Jesus that God him well it was his words and then him having faith that obeying his words would heal him that is what brought him healing it wasn't just him himself or the interaction it was him actually believing that if I do what he says even after 38 long years of trying a different way it'll actually work so how can we actually find Healing is trusting and obeying the words of God and it's very difficult because you have to look at your long history your long life 38 years of nothing working and believing that it just takes this for it all to come together it just takes this trusting it and obeying and believing that it will work because even if you do it you have to believe that it'll work it's simple to do it and not believe that it works and that you'll still run run out empty but you have to believe that it'll work and what's amazing is that it's not a complex answer at all not even in the slightest it's actually us who complicate the Bible it is us who make this extremely complicated God actually gave this to us so that we can understand it it is deep it is profound but it's understandable God gave it to us so that we may know the part that he wants us to know and you know it's interesting he could have said it's like well do I have to pick up my mats you know like could I get up start walking is picking up my mat an essential part of my healing process is that necessary you know and you know people we I'm sure a lot of us have heard these kinds of questions time and time again but is that's not a question you have to ask it's the trusting and obeying exactly what he's telling you that is what brings the healing you know maybe it was like well I've been here for 38 years can I like bask in this moment of my healing can I get up and walk later you know like maybe it's a process maybe I can just you know be healed and I can start walking my in my own time but that wasn't what he said says get up pick up your mat and walk and so literally healing comes from trusting and obeying in exactly what he says and the Bible's simple it's us who complicate it it's us who make it hard looking for ways out looking for how can we tiptoe the line and I know this from personal example trying to find a way to talk to people and say things and do things that maybe aren't sin but if I can try to get away with it word it a certain way or do it a certain way maybe it's okay but that's not how you trust God it's simply obeying exactly what he says that is the only way we'll have peace that is the only way that we will actually get well well and just because you've gotten well once it doesn't mean that you won't need to get well again I find what happens is we are faced with the same question Time After Time After Time because what happens is we get injured and we have injury after injury after injury and things happen and things get worse things get harder we get harder trials and then he asks you that same exact question do you want to get well and you have to answer it the same way that you always have the same way that Jesus calls us to having trust in what he says and that it'll work if you just obey it so no matter what situation that you're in ask yourself do I want to get well if you feel like you're trapped in sin and you're having a hard time overcoming Temptation if you feel like you're having a hard time trusting in people a hard time being vulnerable to people ask yourself do you want to get well when you find yourself not able to give any longer when you find yourself run on empty ask yourself do you want to get well and you can answer that question wholeheartedly you can answer that question truthfully and you can answer it with full obedience because if you can do that you will be and you will have a mind at peace you will have the peace that God has been trying to give you time after time you will have the the freedom that God is trying to give you time after time you will finally fill up that hole that we all have deep inside of us that we've been trying to fill with other things but it'll finally be filled if you could just answer that question and live it out with truth and obedience to God's words so let's actually o obey his words put faith that it'll actually return and it won't return empty to God but we can actually do it and fulfill it and that we can actually get well to God be the glory",

    "summary": "The sermon \"Do You Want To Get Well?\" explores the spiritual journey from brokenness to healing, prompted by Jesus' question to the paralyzed man in John 5. It highlights humanity's inherent deprivation and tendency towards depravity when seeking satisfaction outside of God, contrasting this with King David's initial humility and later fall into sin. The core message emphasizes that true wellness and salvation (sozo) come from desiring God above all else and demonstrating faith through simple, obedient trust in His words, leading to perfect peace.",

        "verse": "John 5:1-9",
        "insight": "The speaker uses the story of the paralyzed man at the pool of Bethesda to pose the sermon's central question: 'Do you want to get well?' He emphasizes that Jesus sees our condition and the duration of our suffering before we even ask for help. The man's healing came not from the pool, but from believing and obeying Jesus' direct command to 'Get up, pick up your mat and walk,' illustrating that healing requires active trust in God's simple words."

        "verse": "2 Samuel 7:8-29",
        "insight": "This passage showcases King David's initial humble and grateful response to God's profound promises, which included establishing his kingdom and an everlasting covenant for his descendants. The speaker uses this to illustrate a pure desire for God, where all the blessings and gifts from God are seen as secondary and 'extra' to the relationship itself, prompting listeners to examine their own motivations for seeking God."

        "insight": "Contrasting David's earlier devotion, this passage highlights his significant moral failure involving Bathsheba and Uriah, and Nathan the prophet's confrontation. The speaker points out David's loss of humility and his desire for something other than God, explaining that even a 'man after God's own heart' can despise God's commands when giving into the flesh and wanting what is not God."

This reliance on God is crucial for enduring hardships and overcoming temptations, echoing Jesus' ability to endure the cross through joy set before Him."

    "transcript": "I'm so excited preach for y all let's just go right into it go to Deuteronomy chapter 10 and uh I hope you guys are still with me I know usually we probably start a little bit earlier but we had some amazing good news shared for us today my my title for you guys today is simply God wants your all God wants your all I think it's very interesting when you have a lesson and the communion and the contribution go exactly with the lesson and that's exactly what happened today as we read this passage Deuteronomy chapter 10 in verse 12 the Bible reads and now Israel what does the Lord your God ask of you except to fear the lord your God by walking in all his ways to love him and to Worship the Lord your God with all your hearts and all your soul keep the Lord's commands and statutes I am giving you today for your own good see this is what we see time and time and time again in the Bible people might be confused we might be confused on what does God ask of us what does he require of us and maybe you're asking that question right now what does God want from me what can I do for him and the question is simple has always been the same answer to give God your all he wants all your hearts all your soul he wants you to follow all of his ways that's what God asks us about asks of us and he lays it out perfectly he even adds in there to fear Him of course to have reverence for him and I find what makes it difficult we're going to be talking about what makes it difficult to have that Soul focus on giving God everything on giving God all that we have I find it to be sometimes distractions Temptations uh it could be doubts whether you have in yourself in God or in other people around you it could be the lack of trust that you have same thing in yourself in other people or in God and all these things they they block us from giving our all to God so when you look at the scripture just ask yourself am I obeying this scripture it's so easy to point to other scriptures well I do this I do that almost like a checkbox a checklist and a grocery list of making sure you when you go to heaven you have all of God's groceries ready for but no God wants you to give him everything at all times and I find the scripture powerful when you ask yourself this question you know am I obeying the scripture and before you say yes I want to tell you guys something don't let your previous convictions overwrite the current state of your soul so if you have made previous great decisions to be a disciple previously you've given your all and you can point to this this that and that in the past it doesn't matter if right now you're not giving him your all you have to always give him your all and I love it in verse 13 it literally says for your own good like we're gonna get into this but literally why do we give God our all is for our own good we have no benefit of giving God a drawn back heart we have no benefit in giving God drawn back efforts 90% it gives us absolutely nothing but we like to perceive that it gives us something and so we're going to get into this talking about God wants your all let's go to Romans Chapter 2 and in terms of what could take us away from focusing on God whether it be sin or anyone or anything that draws back our Focus I was looking at this quote by Winston Churchill and he said you will never reach your destination if you stop and throw stones at every dog that barks and the idea is this you're looking to have a peaceful Journey like God is walking with me you're enjoying your time and then you hear some dog yapping at you and you're like shut up you're distracting me on my peaceful journey and the dog is not the blame for your lack of peace you are disturbed by the dog and so this is the real issue is that we stop giving our all to God because we start focusing on the distractions but the distractions are not the reason why you have a lack of peace it is because of you so the Israelites when they left slavery they did this constantly you know they would say things like God we have no food God and when God would give him food like we don't like this food God give us meat and then they're complaining God we have no water God what Moses is in charge and Aaron no God we should be in charge all the Lord's people are holy you know they they see God those people who live in the promised land those big giants they're too big for us we can't go you know what I think that you chose Moses so we could die here in the wilderness and they would bring excuse after EXC excuse complaint after complaint and what it is they're throwing stones at the dogs when literally none of them died of starvation in the wilderness none of them died of injury the people that died were those that lost focus of God the people that died in the wilderness were those that were grumbling and complaining and then God said you're not entering the promised lands when if anything it was the complete opposite like literally we would think that having no food and water in the wilderness is a very big deal but God did it to test them and he revealed what was in their hearts so when we read the Bible we see exactly what not to do and so when we see their example it's incredible literally they went without a single sandal being you know destroyed or misplaced like God did not let their feet grow weary he did not let their shoes wear out he did not let their clothes get holes in them but they were just so focused on the trials they forgot to realize all that God was doing for them like I get a pair of Vans and within a year they're destroyed they're decimated but they went 40 years in a desert not a single hole and they forgot about that because they were so focused on on everything happening against them and we do the same exact thing maybe I can come up here and preach and maybe you're like who's you know may Anthony who's this 24 yearold coming up here right now I I didn't like that Liston let me get a nice season preacher to come up here and maybe that's true amen you know maybe it's questions like you know I just don't like the leadership right now I'm seriously doubting you know all the Lord's people are holy yes it's in the Bible but I know how to do it right they did it wrong you know maybe it's things you draw back your heart because other people around you might be making the same decisions you're surrounding yourself with maybe some disciples who are really doubting themselves and then people who are not disciples that are definitely want nothing to do with God and you're like well this is normal I can draw back too or maybe it's like I'll do the right thing when they do the right thing I can live righteously when I know the people around me are making those same decisions and God tested the Israelites because all of those reasons actually are super valid not having water is pretty valid not having food in a desert is pretty valid so what happens is we use the validation as an excuse for us to sin whether it's true or not doesn't matter God put that out there to see how they would respond so the fact of something being true how how bad things are around you isn't actually what matters it's about how you respond and in Romans Chapter 2 we're going to read and break down a chunk of this here but in the same way God has tested the Israelites with all their validations I want you ask yourself this question how will you obey God when it seems like the logic reason is it not to how will you obey God when you look at your circumstance your life the people around you and you can come up with some valid conclusion that maybe you shouldn't how will you choose to obey God in Romans Chapter 2 in verse one the Bible reads therefore every one of you who judges is without excuse for when you judge one another you condemn yourself since you the judge do the same things now we know that God's judgment on those who do such things is based on the truth do you think any one of you who judges those who do such things yet do the same that you will escape God's judgment or do you despise The Riches of his kindness restraint and patience not recognizing that God's kindness is intended to lead you to to repentance because of your hardened and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of Wrath when God's righteous judgment is revealed he will repay each one according to his Works eternal life to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory honor and immortality but wrath and anger to those who are self-seeking and disobey the truth while obeying unrighteousness see we're going to divide this p m in the two parts and we'll break it down my first point for you guys is look at yourself simply look at yourself don't do what the Israelites did looked at everything around them no look at yourself and this is incredible because Paul wrote this letter to the church to disciples to people who made the decision that Jesus is Lord and what he's saying is that why are you judging when you judge you condemn yourselves so he's writing a letter to people who made the decision to become disciples and they are condemning themselves and let's see a little bit of why if you read in chapter one what are they judging in chapter 1 verse 28 and because they did not think it worthwhile talking about those who are non-christians to acknowledge God God delivered them over to a corrupt mind so that they do what is not right they are filled with all unright rightousness evil greed and wickedness they are full of Envy murder quarrels deceit and Malice they are gossips slanderers god- haters arrogant proud boastful inventors of evil disobedient to parents senseless untrustworthy unloving and unmerciful although they know God's just sentence that those who practice such things deserve to die they not only do them but they applaud others who practice them so here is what we do constantly we look at other people we look at them committing Injustice we look at them committing wickedness we look at them committing sin and sometimes they do things and you're like you're totally shipwreck your faith you're totally in contradiction to the scriptures and often times you might even be dumbfounded we're like drawn back we're like what kind of decision was that even to the point where we're questioning but but what the issue is is that we see it but we're blind because we do the same exact things that's right sometimes oh my goodness why would they make a decision like they drew all these people away we do it all the time we make slight decisions like that all the time like why would they commit that sin man don't they see like they're a disciple we do the same thing constantly and so it's like we literally look and we judge others but we fail to recognize our shortcomings we have to look at ourselves you know one time if I can be open with you guys I'm gonna share something I did it was it was really stupid I'll share the story so Natalie um wanted a a key we lived in an apartment lived in a household and they only gave us three keys but there's four people living there and so I had the key for Natalie and I right and but she really wanted a key because sometimes you know we had to really exchange we're planning who gets home first do you take the key okay but like trying to figure that out and so she wanted me to get her a copy of the key right and after a bit I finally get her a copy and we're coming back from being on campus for a while and hey babe you know here's the copy to the key you know just don't forget it you know as we go home you know and we get out the car we head toward the elevator and she's like babe I I think I left the key in the car in my sin in my frustration you know and trying to make light but the same time like kind of disappointed I was like well the key doesn't belong there now does it and I was trying to make it light-hearted but I was totally sinful I was totally prideful I was like oh my goodness and she's like babe why would you say that like I just forgot I just forgot something we just go back and get it and it wasn't until of a few days later that I forgot something and and and then I don't even think that said anything I don't know what I forgot but she's like looked at me and and that was a year ago why do I remember that a year literally a year later this is a year ago is because now what etched in my mind that if she does something before I open my mouth I ask myself have I done that thing do I do that as well and if I've done it even once I don't say anything that's that's the rule I have not come up with I like literally self assessed the moment she's anything I'm all right have I done that okay let me show Grace that's the answer and we do when we look at people whether they're disciples making bad decisions or non- disciples making terrible decisions we have to really self assess and realize wait I do that all the time I'm not above it I am not more moral than the people around me because I have made the decision to become a disciple I have to make the decision every day to look at myself and give God my all and it's so important to do so and I I you know they let me to share that story but I want you guys to think about it right there's no reason to look at someone and be like what kind of decision was that think of Jesus Jesus when presented with an adulterous Woman and and the Pharisees about to Stone her the the Trap Jesus Jesus says he who is without sin cast the first stone and that's incredible because it was a sin where according to the Old Testament they should have stoned her and so literally in a very true manner Jesus says why would you judge something even correctly if you are wrong yourself why would you cast judgment are you without judgment are you without sin and you know what happens when you judge and you look outwardly and you stop looking at yourself in verse four it literally says do you despise The Riches of God's kindness restraint and patience and then do you and you don't recognize that his kindness is intended to lead us to repentance when you judge others you despise what God is trying to give you and let me show you why go to eclesiastes chapter 8 in Ecclesiastes chapter 8 just going to read a little portion here it says in verse 11 because the sentence against an evil Act is not carried out quickly the heart of people is filled with the desire to commit commit evil this is our nature this is how us human beings are designed we see sin we see wickedness we see Injustice and in our spiritual bodies we have somehow concluded that we can sin to no one's above this no one is without this this is literally our nature and so the way we go against that is we stop looking at what others are doing we stop looking and judging how could they do that kind of sin how could they make that decision we look at ourselves and realize that we are full of sin and so whenever you see anyone do anything that you believe is against the Bible First look at yourself realize the grace that God has given you and don't despise his riches because when you judge others you despise them when you look to others on yourself you despise them look at yourself and realize what God is trying to give you see every time you take the focus off of yourself and put it on others who are doing unrighteousness you're putting another dollar in the piggy bank of bitterness you're adding another dollar in the piggy bank of ungratefulness in the the piggy bank of Doubt of lack of trust and you're adding it and you're adding it and adding it and then if you go back to Romans Chapter 2 it l says you're storing up wrath so on the day of judgment you're like God here are some of my good deeds I did all this for you but but here here is all of my UNG gratitude here's this Mass massive load of wealth of my ungratefulness of my bitterness of my lack of trust yes here's my good deeds but I was storing all this up for you too God and we store up wrath for ourselves and so instead of being rich in Good Deeds you've made a heftier wealth in your wrath in your unrighteousness and that's what happens when you stop looking to yourself and you start to cast judgment on others and so family it's simple we can't do what the Israelites did in the wilderness where they lost their lives because of their lack of focus on God literally they were in there for 40 years when they didn't have to be when the promised land was around the corner they all died in the wilderness and the ones who made it were their children so let us focus on ourselves let us look to ourselves whether the battle is real whether the doubts are real whether it's true let us focus on ourselves and what we could do and the second part of this passage in verse six it says he will repay each one according to his Works eternal life to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory honor and immortality but wrath and anger to those who are self-seeking and disobey the truth while obeying unrighteousness the word persistent when it says persistence in doing good in the Greek it l is pronounced hoon and this is what it actually says when you look at the definition of the Greek it says um the characteristic of a man who is unswerving from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and peity by even the greatest trials and suffering does this describe you and once again before you immediately answer yes think about who it does describe Jesus who under immense trial even from the first time he ever preached a lesson they wanted to throw him off a cliff but he kept going so under immense trial a uh immense anguish immense suffering he still persevered through so before you answer that question are you persistent as of have you fully adopted that characteristic of Jesus Christ is that Christ is that Christlike quality really fully a part of who you are let's go to Proverbs 24 Proverbs chapter 24 challenging scripture in verse 10 if you do nothing in a difficult time your strength is limited rescue those being taken off to death and save those stumbling toward Slaughter if you say but we didn't know about this won't he who weighs the heart considerate won't he who protects your life no won't he repay a person according to his work Point number two God weighs the heart and it says when you do nothing and I love some translations um I believe the NIV says when you falter uh the nasb it says when you slack off when you slack off in days of trouble the the kjb says when you faint you know like you see a tough time coming and you're just oh no God wo was me oh God like I can't do that you know when he faints but the idea of it being narrow right the your strength being limited it literally means narrow like imagine you're stuck between two Cliffs there is no way you can move your arms so your strength being limited it means it is not at its fullest potential it is limited in a small space and it cannot grow whenever you do nothing in times of trouble and the reason why this is significant is because in verse 12 it says but we didn't know about this what happens is when we don't make the right decisions in hard times we make excuses but God I didn't know I I'm just a victim I was told this I was told that people did this around me I was just doing what everyone else was doing but it says in verse 12 won't he who weighs the heart consider it so no matter what you say as an excuse God is going to take what you say and then take your heart and actually weigh it he's going to see if what you're saying actually matches the deepest most darkest recesses of your hearts and are they correlated and it's it's kind of significant because when you think about it the heart is deceitful so we could actually be making an excuse and believe it wholeheartedly but the Bible says we could be lying to ourselves and believing that lie let's go to Jeremiah 17 let's see exactly what it says in Jeremiah 17 it says in verse 9 the heart is more deceitful than anything else and incurable who can understand it I the Lord examine the minds I test the hearts once again to give to each according to his way according to what his actions deserve so if you ask yourself this question what is my heart full of if you stood before God and he heard everything you said saw all that you did if he took your heart and waited what would your heart be full of I think sometimes we look at our heart and we see at the Baseline there's Faith there's convictions but we topped it off with doubt with criticalness with ungratefulness with lack of conviction and we're like at the core of it God you must want what at the core of it but no God is looking at all of your hearts he is weighing it completely but if the heart is deceitful we could be lying to ourselves the idea of your heart being deceitful is that you have it says in James chapter 1 when you don't become a doer of the word you deceive yourself and that that happens when you hear it and you hear it and you hear it but you never do it and so to have the result and you know get past cognitive dissonance you believe in the lie so you may believe that you're okay and it's not just that oh you lie to yourself to get past certain things but you believe in the lie you believe the Bible is telling you something when it is not to compensate for your lack of obedience and so what do you do what what can we do if our hearts are lying to ourselves it's a kind of interesting question now we're stuck now we're stuck in the spot where is our heart then if I can't even answer truthfully then what do I do with my heart well let's go to Second Peter chapter 3 and we'll close out here in second Peter chapter 3 in verse 8 the Bible reads dear friends don't overlook this one fact with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day the Lord does not delay his promise as some understand delay but is patient with you not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come like a thief on that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise the elements will burn and be dissolved and the earth and the works on it will be dis disclosed since all these things are to be dissolved in this way it is clear what sort of people you should be in holy conduct and godliness as you wait for the day of God and H is coming because of that day the heavens will be dissolved with fire and the elements will melt with heat but based on his promise we wait for new heavens and the new Earth where righteousness dwells therefore dear friends while you wait for these things make every effort to be found without spot or blemish in his sight and at peace I love this passage it says that God doesn't want anyone to perish and I love what he said says in comparison he wants all to come to repentance and every time the Bible words something a specific way we have to listen closely he doesn't say I don't want all to perish I want all to come to Salvation I want all to come to repentance why because repentance is salvation I think sometimes people view Christianity as a means to an end to enter Heaven but Heaven is on earth when you repent of your s you have true peace and you can actually be completely in right standing with God because of your repentance and not you're not just waiting for the day when you die you have it right now you have that peace with God and it's amazing because the idea of repentance is not just that you gain salvation but Salvation is like the completion of your repentance because you suffer you suffer suffer you endure hardship after hardship you fight Temptation you fight doubts you fight criticisms and ungratefulness and Time After Time and you're persevering you're persistent you're trying to be like Jesus so one day when you do die and you don't know when it comes you're at the foot of God at the foot of the cross and it's glorious it's glorious because all that you've endured all that you've pushed through not because you've checked off a box but because you fought to the very end you gave your all and as the Bible says you made every effort so what do you do if your heart might be lying to you give every efforts when you say to yourself well I don't know what my heart says that I am but I'm going to decide right now to make every effort that's what God's looking for when you look at people around you and the decisions that they're making whether they be good or worse or terrible it doesn't matter because you're going to make every single efforts to be found without spot or blemish that is what we do it doesn't matter what you might think or where your heart might be at make the decision right now to make every effort because God weighs the heart and since God weighs a heart we have to look at oursel not look to others look at ourselves and look for repentance within ourselves not for others in ourselves and if you can look in yourself lead yourself to repentance M through the word because God weighs the heart then you can start to give God your all you can start to give God everything and therefore you will have that persistent diligent and unswerving effort to be found without spot without spot or blemish so let us give God our all after he weighs the heart so that we can actually be at peace with him not just in heaven but here on Earth as well to God

        "insight": "The speaker explains that this passage reveals God's simple request for Israel (and for us): to fear, love, and worship Him with all our heart and soul, walking in all His ways. He emphasizes that giving anything less than our all, even 90% effort, is not beneficial to us and that complete devotion is for our own good."

        "verse": "Romans 2:1-8",
        "insight": "Paul's letter, addressed to disciples, is interpreted as a warning against judging others while committing similar sins, thereby condemning oneself. The speaker highlights that such judgment despises God's kindness, which is meant to lead to repentance, and instead leads to storing up wrath for the day of judgment rather than seeking glory, honor, and immortality through persistent good deeds."

        "verse": "Jeremiah 17:9-10",
        "insight": "The speaker emphasizes that the heart is inherently 'deceitful and incurable,' meaning we can lie to ourselves and believe those lies, particularly to compensate for a lack of obedience.

    "transcript": "thank you so much for singing that song I think that it's incredible when the song leaders pick a song that'll speak on and we'll sing about exactly what the lesson will be on and it's totally unplaned totally by the spirit so thank you so much for picking that song please turn to Matthew chapter 5 Matthew Chapter 5 we're going to look at uh the Beatitudes right now and I think that there's a little bit of a correlation between every single beatitude in Matthew Chapter 5 and verse three the Bible reads blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled blessed are the merciful for they will be shown Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecute the prophets who were before you see I love the correlation between them it talks about the poor in spirits those who are in mourning those who are Meek those who are pure in Hearts those who are persecuted and it's really describing somebody who has literally lost everything one who desires one who searches and one who seeks for God looks for a pure heart it doesn't matter what persecutions come their way it doesn't matter their situation that they will show peace it doesn't matter what life goes against them they will be merciful and it truly describes somebody who I believe is truly broken before the cross someone who is truly they they are no longer living for themselves but they've given everything to follow Christ and so in all of these things you know those who uh ultimately together they are the ones that see their need for God they see that their their need to show peace their need to be merciful their need to have a pure heart and there're those who look for those answers the answer to what will actually Grant these things because they no longer try to get it for themselves they no longer try to get it through what the world has to offer they see that you know what God is the one who fulfills these God is the one who is the answer and it's super important because the world everything around us tries to tell you the exact opposite you know what it's saying you can be in control you control all that happens around you and if you can't control it it's not your fault it's everyone else's fault to teach you how to be a victim the the world tells you to follow your hearts we hear that a lot just just do what you feel like but you know if you follow your heart enough then you start to believe that if your heart feels bad things once again it's everyone else's fault and everything that the world tries to get you to believe it's also you can lose your need for God if you can believe that you have the power that you're in control and the only time that something is wrong is because you're a victim to the circumstance around you and and it gets you to believe that you could have power to control it then you diminish and you lose that need for God but that is not what Jesus wants I love the first thing he says blessed are the poor in spirits the word poor in the Greek it literally means to resort to begging the poor in spirits those who have reached a point in their lives and realize that there is nothing else but to beg for God to ask for his spirits and I I once again I look at everything here and I think that the message that God wants us to see from the Beatitudes is to see our need for him and not just a need that we just take with us but the idea that we are absolutely nothing and we are literally in our lives because of our sin we have to resort to begging to God to bowing before him my title for us today is simply blessed are the poor in spirits and point number one is simply be at the Bott be at the bottom let's go to Daniel chapter 4 we're going to follow the account of a man who God forcibly had to put at the bot Daniel chapter 4 says in verse verse one uh King Nebuchadnezzar to the Nations and the peoples of every language who live in all the Earth may you prosper greatly it is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the most high God has performed for me how great are his signs how Mighty his wonders his kingdom his eternal Kingdom his Dominion endurance from generation to generation I Nebuchadnezzar was at home in my Palace contented and prosperous I had a dream that made me afraid as I was lying in bed the images and the visions that passed through my mind terrified me so just setting up the scenario here right Nebuchadnezzar was a king of Babylon and in this time very specifically he was the king that took all of the the the people who are from Judah into captivity in the slavery and the only people that he didn't take into captivity were killed and the only people that were killed they died of Salvation or they died of disease so he literally took the smallest group of people who were meant to be God's people in the Captivity he was literally used as an instrument of punishment for judah's sins and in this it starts off and he's literally speaking in verse one so the man who God used as an instrument to punish God's people is literally now speaking as he has an own chapter of his own writing in the Bible and so we're going to see exactly why in this said but he's literally giving glory to God but he goes back a little bit he's he's going into a story on how he got to this point and it talks about a vision that he has and we're going to read this vision and kind of see why it troubled him it says in verse 10 these are the Visions I saw while lying in bed I looked and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land its height was enormous the tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky it was visible to all to the end of the Earth its leaves were beautiful as fruit abundant and on it was food for all under the wild animals found Sher found shelter and the birds lived in his branches from it every creature was fed in the vision I saw while lying in bed I looked and there before me was a Holy One a messenger coming down from heaven he called in a loud voice cut down the tree and trim off its branches strip off its leaves and Scatter its fruits let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches but let the stump and its roots bound with iron and bronze remain in the ground in the grass of the fields let him be drenched with the de of heaven and let him live with the animals among the plants of the Earth let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal till seven times pass by for him so this was the dream that he had he envisioned a massive tree has anyone here seen the Redwood sycamore trees that are in California they they're incredible and some of them are so massive and they're so large in circumference in diameter that if went to put your arms around it they would be flat like they'd be huge like I mean from from that green the beginning of that green little padding so probably like right here they're huge in diameter they're just massive and they're still you know they're huge they last they're living for thousands of years but the tree that's described here is described as so large that every person on Earth could see this tree so I imagine a trunk like bigger than the diameter of this entire gym and that's how massive and how glorious this tree is and then it says that his top reaches the heaven imagine a tree where it's so tall it's like in is compared to Mount Everest where clouds cover not even half of us and it's describing the glory the the the the magnificence of this single tree but it goes a bit further and it says let him be drenched in the Jew of heaven and give him the mind of an animal so this tree is actually a person and so that's why Nebuchadnezzar was so startled he's like who is this tree I hope this tree wasn't me because God said to cut it down I really hope this tree is not me but let's see you know what happens when he looks for an answer to this dream let's go to verse 19 says then Daniel also called belar was greatly perplexed for a time and his thoughts terrified him so the king said uh belar do not let the dream or meing alarm you belar answered my Lord if only the dream applied to your enemies that's the fun thing to say don't let it alarm you but like just pretend like I'm not talking about you right now this is I can't imagine that right uh but then he says and it's meaning for your adversaries the tree you saw which grew large and strong with its top touching the sky visible to the whole earth with beautiful leaves and abundant fruits providing food for all giving shelter to wild animals and having nesting places in his branches for the birds your majesty you are that tree you have become great and strong your greatness has Shone until it reaches the sky and your Dominion extends to distant parts of the earth your majesty saw a Holy One a messenger coming down from heaven and saying cut down the tree and destroy it but leave the St bound with iron and bronze in the grass of the field while its roots remain in the ground let him be dressed in the Jew of Heaven and let him live with the wild animals until seven times pass by for him this is the interpretation your M to see and this is the cree the most highest issued against my Lord the king you will be driven away from the people and will live with the wild animals you will eat grass like an ox and be drenched with the DW of Heaven seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the most high is Sovereign over all kingdoms on Earth and give them to anyone he wishes he command uh the command to leave the stump of the tree with his roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that heaven rules Therefore your majesty be pleased to accept my advice renounce your sins by doing what is right and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed it may be that then your Prosperity will continue see Daniel a man of God inter interpret this dream and he has bad news he's like King I'm sorry this is you at some point for seven years you will eat grass like an ox you will be drenched with the Dew of Heaven like you will not have the mind of a human but the mind of an animal and he's literally foreseeing that his sanity will leave him and this is super important because Nebuchadnezzar he did not see himself as someone at the bottom he saw himself as he was this tree and so if we keep reading right in verse 28 all this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar 12 months later as the King was walking on the roof of the Royal Palace of Babylon he said is not this the great Babylon I have built as the Royal residence by my Majesty but no by my mighty power and for the glory of my Majesty even as the words were on his lips of voice Came From Heaven this is what is decreed for you King Nebuchadnezzar your Royal Authority has been taken from you you will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals you will eat grass like an ox seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the most high is Sovereign over all kingdoms on Earth and giv them to anyone he wishes immediately what what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled he was driven away from the people and ate grass like an Ox his body was drenched with the Dew of Heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird see this is exactly what happens when you don't view yourself at the bottom and you start to bring yourself Glory see Nebuchadnezzar literally as he was walking and talking and you know thinking about all the ways that he's glorified himself all the ways that he's great as he's still talking a messenger comes before he even finishes he gets judgment and this is you know is super important because his issue was simply what it said before to stop all his wrongdoing the repent of his sins and stop oppressing those stop oppressing the weak and if you really think about it like imagine someone who oppresses those who are weaker than them I saw a video recently of I don't know if it was stag you know you see a video online and it's like two coincidental for like the person be recording the most random events and this young man was about to get into a bus and an elderly lady he literally like pushed her to the side to get in front of her and I was like like that way yeah could be AI you know but regardless if it was real or fake immediately your mind goes what is wrong with that young man immediately whether it's real or fake like the the Justice sensors in our brains are like that is ter terrible why would you do that right look at you trying to think that you're better than this person they've lived a lot longer than you they they have so much more wisdom so much more life than you and here you are to think that you're better because you're stronger and to push them aside and it's terrible to see and so that is exactly what Nebuchadnezzar was doing on a constant basis just constantly oppressing people pushing those aside who are weaker than him and and here's what's crazy is that when you see someone like that you automatically think they're the worst of the worst they're like the bottom they're like the lowest of the low right so Nebuchadnezzar was at the bottom but he viewed himself as someone at the top and what happens is when you don't realize your position in this world before God and humble yourself God will forcibly put you in that situation to where you realize that you are at the bottom and uh it's crazy because God has this great plan in Philippians chapter 2 it says every knee shall bow and so you know God puts us at the bottom because you know we have to learn to put ourselves there first and if we don't choose to see ourselves at the bottom he will literally Force our hands he will make it to where we have to see we're at the bottom we're at the lowest of lows and I believe many of us here have experienced that you know we've realized we try to live a life that's great that's pleasing to ourselves but the reason why we're here today is because we realize that it doesn't work it gets us absolutely nowhere and if you're contemplating that right now debating whether or not maybe there is a way that we can have peace outside of this there is a way to have power outside of the Bible Well it's not true there's only one way and if you don't realize that God will force your hands and he will put you at the bottom let's go to Matthew 19 in Matthew 19 this is uh one of the most challenging accounts I've ever read of Jesus and in verse 16 the Bible reads just then a man came up to Jesus and ask teacher what good thing must I do to get inter life okay so this is what I believe most of us would do if Jesus was holding you know a a discussion group I believe the first question question would be how do we get to heaven so he is doing what we all want to do how do I jesus get to heaven I need to hear it directly directly from you just give me the answer right and in verse uh 17 it says why do you ask me about what is good Jesus replied there's only one who is good if you want to enter life keep the Commandments which ones he acquired Jesus replied you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not give false testimony honor your father mother and love your neighbor as yourself all these I have kept the young man said what do I still lack Jesus answered if you want to be perfect go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me when the young man heard this he went away sad because he had great wealth then Jesus said to the disciples truly I tell you it is hard for someone who is Rich to enter the kingdom of heaven and in this story this man comes to Jesus with a question that we all would ask him and he gets an answer according to what he wanted he's he literally asked him what must I do to enter Heaven and Jesus says obey the Commandments and I knew and we all know that he knew this he knows he obeyed the commands that Jesus I've done all this in other account says I've done all this since I was a boy since I was young I have always obeyed the Commandments and so you get this sense that he comes to Jesus not actually looking for answer but looking for reassurance yeah looking for Jesus to confirm who we already is Jesus like come on if I can hear from you God that I'm doing a good job then that's that's good for me if I can hear from you God that you like the way I am right now that's good for me but Jesus actually didn't give him that answer and the way I think of it too um one time I was walking through a Publix and I I tried Tred to be pretty Frugal so I went in with uh we were moving and I had a Home Depot their prices for packing tape on my phone and Publix is near my house so I just walked there and I just went just to compare the prices you know I just want to see like all right which is cheaper all right this is 10 cents cheaper this is okay you know if I get this brand I'm this what I'm thinking right but as I'm walking uh there's there's a kid and you know uh he was trying to convince his mom to buy him this like magazine I don't know if it was or about games but he's like Mom like can can we please get this magazine please just look at it's so great and then his like oh no way like that magazine is way too expensive it's 20 bucks and and the kid said the kid's answer was hilarious he says well at least it's not 25 and his his his method of persuasion was mom like it could be worse it could be 30 bucks wouldn't you rather get me a $20 magazine than a $25 magazine like come on it could be a lot worse right and we do it to God all the time you know this is little yes it's like God like you know look at my life it's pretty good it it could be worse could can't you accept it for what it is because of how worse it could be you see the Badness the wickedness that I could be doing I refrain from a good portion of it so don't you see that I should be accepted for who I am right now it could be a lot worse God and we make these kinds of excuses that are are nothing what God wants us to do because it's prideful it's because we all of a sudden think that we're worthy of acceptance but that's not how we should stand before God and this man says he has followed the Commandments since he was a boy he believed he was good enough and that's why he went to Jesus Jesus I'm good enough I I I've always done your Commandments I've always obeyed what the word says and he's like I could be worse but the issue is that uh his life it it didn't reach a point to where he realized that he had to be at the bottom so Jesus gives him a very unorthodox answer he literally tells them if you want to be perfect and the word perfect in the Greek is simply means tellios and it means complete Jesus says if you want to be complete what do we learn from this is that simply obeying the Commandments doesn't complete you before Jesus he's telling him you have to empty yourself because of his wealth because of you know his his pride and his capability of obeying the Commandments he believed he was worth something but the issue is that Jesus gave him a personal and individual command for him to empty himself so he could finally see that he is nothing and other accounts say in Mark that Jesus looked at him and loved him why is this so loving imagine like the amount of people on Earth even we ourselves who go months years sometimes our entire lives just looking for an answer of how we can actually consider ourselves nothing before God and Jesus looked at him loved him and gave him that exact answer what you personally need to do to be completely empty before God but here's the issue that he walked away sad see when we understand that there's something that keeps us from being completely empty it's always going to be a challenge it's never going to be easy but because of his pride he didn't want to accept it he believed that his obedience was enough but his obedience wasn't enough because he wasn't empty enough it doesn't matter how much you might obey you have to be at the bottom before God we have sometimes I think that I'll speak for me personally is we see I see my knowledge in the scriptures I'll see maybe my experience and I start to kind of crawl myself out and God tries harder to kind of push me back down to seem like you're nothing you have to see it and that's God's discipline that's God refining you he's trying to help you realize that you are in a permanent position bowing before the cross and he's doing our best he's doing his best to help us see that so Jesus gave him the exact answer that we're all looking for how exactly can we empty ourselves at a personal and individual level so we can always be and always realize that we're at the bottom and have you guys seen that picture of you know the the little child with the teddy bear you know and you have Jesus with the bigger one behind like Jesus is L asking hey empty your hands so I can give you something more glorious empty what you possess so I can give you something more glorious and it's going to feel for a time like you have nothing there's going to be a period of time when your hands have nothing in them but you need to experience that so you could understand how glorious this will be see Jesus he wants us to be complete in heaven because you know we see that this world is empty he wants us to empty our hands of this world he he wants us to be complete in his spirit because our our flesh is empty our flesh means nothing he wants us to be complete in him because we ourselves are nothing we have to completely empty ourselves and really see that everything is nothing before the cross so we can be at the bottom before him and to be at the bottom is simply just to be emptied of what you have you know the Bible says in Luke 14 to give up everything to renounce all of your possessions and if you want to know if you're at the bottom or not really ask yourself does your need for God make your needs for other things go away when you think about how much you need God does it make everything go away I love the the communion that Noah preached and he talked about you know the idea of bread and saying that you know we man should not live on bread alone literally God calls us to see what sustains our day-to-day lives as nothing compared to his word does your need for him make all your other needs go away and then the other question is what you see in this passage do you accept personal challenges and doing whatever it takes to be close to God or do you reject like the Rich Young Ruler certain challenges because it's not exactly a scripture see Jesus gave him something that's nowhere in the Bible you will not see a single scripture that you have to sell everything to be a disciple but he gave him a personal challenge so how do you know if you're empty how do you know if you're actually putting yourself at the bottom before God puts you there is that you will do whatever it takes accept any personal challenge regardless if if it's you know a direct commandment or not and I love it because in even in Hebrews 11 it literally says to not only cast aside the sin that entangles but everything that hinders in Colossians chapter 3 it says you've thrown away the body with its evil desires it's like everything and guess what the evil desires go to like everything is given up everything is lost we don't consider anything is worth having before Jesus because we have to reach the bottom before God puts us there and go through exactly what Nebuchadnezzar went through but luckily thankfully sometimes God lets us experience and he puts us at the bottom while also giving us time to repent not many times do we get that that Grace and that Mercy sometimes he puts you there and he'll give you time to get out of it so let's keep read go back to Daniel 4 in Daniel chapter 4 uh let's pick up where we left off in verse uh 34 at the end of that time I Nebuchadnezzar raised my eyes toward heaven and my sanity was restored when I praised the most high I honored him and glorified him who Liv forever his Dominion is an eternal Kingdom his kingdom endures from generation to Generation all the peoples of Earth are regarded as nothing he does as he pleases and his his powers with the powers of Heaven and the people of Earth no one can hold back his hand or say to him what have you done at the same time that my family and rest sword my honor and Splendor returned to me for uh for the glory of my kingdom my advisor and Noble sought me out and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and exalt and glorify the king of Heaven because everything he does is right and all his ways are just and those who walk in Pride he is able to Humble see is a really incredible thing what happened to Nebuchadnezzar when his claw his fingernails were like Eagle talents his hair was like feathers and he was eating grass like an ox all so God could humble him and realize at any point he could be snatched from him at any point he could have nothing that he's not in control it's not about his power it's not about his glory it's about God's and so God put him at the bottom because he didn't see it he put him there so he can finally realize it and I love what the passage says say at the end of that time I Nebuchadnezzar rais my eyes toward heaven and my sanity was restored I just imagine what it's like to have the thoughts of an animal like all you're thinking is just survival you're thinking of all your the uh the surrounding environments you're thinking okay I gotta make sure I get enough food I gotta make sure I do this I got to run when I have to and all these thoughts cloudy making you anxious making you stressed and we're not any difference all the times that we feel like we're lacking peace our our mind is constantly flustered with stress with anxiety with sinful desires it just comes and it comes and it comes and you want to finally stop yeah but it says his standing was finally restored and he raised his eyes towards heaven I can't imagine that feeling like all of a sudden your mind is just stilled after seven long years your mind is stilled and you look toward God I I can imagine that that the sun probably feels a little bit warmer you know I imagine the breeze feels a little bit lighter because your sanity is finally restored and he had that peace and he gave back the glory that he was trying to take for himself and gave it all to God he gave it right back to him and God let him experience that and what we literally see the fruit of that is this King that was used to kill murder wipe out and enslave the the all the people from Judah has a a chapter in the Bible that he wrote isn't that amazing to think about that that's the amount of repentance God allowed him to have and really after this point you hear no more from him it just it just goes to the next king and you know and I can't speak for the Bible but we can assume that that he ended this way he ended his life glorifying God isn't that incredible he experienced living like an animal for seven long years and then all we know that's left of them is that he gives glory to God in his very last days see we have to raise our eyes towards heaven once you're at the bottom literally the only place you could look is up that's the last place you could look and you realize that but once you start crawling your way out trying to believe that you know it's by your power you can do things you have control your desires aren't that bad Sin isn't that bad and you start you know inching your way up and up and up God's going to keep trying to push you back down so the only thing that is left for you to do is to finally look up and the raise your eyes towards heaven I want to close out in a in a chapter here Psalm chapter 37 I want to read this chapter uh part of this chapter and then I want to read uh quick song for you guys in the song book in Psalm chapter 37 in verse 5 the Bible reads commit your way to the Lord trust in him and he will do this he will make your righteous re shine like the dawn your Vindication like the Noonday Sun be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him do not fret when people succeed in their ways when they carry out their wicked schemes see God wants us to not have our mind cluttered and Scattered and focused on all that's going around us he wants us to really iiz that we're at the bottom and so once you realize that you're at the bottom then you can finally have that peace your mind could finally be stilled because the only place for you to look is not at your situation not at the the you trying to be a victim in this world but the only place to look is up towards heaven now I want to read this last song here it's in the song book uh it's called abide in me and I just want to read a few verses here the last two verses says I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless ills have no weights and tears no bitterness where's death sting where grave thy Victory I Triumph still if thou abide with me hold thy cross before my closing eyes shine through through the gloom and point me to the skies Heaven's morning breaks and Earth's vain Shadow flee in life in death oh Lord abide with me and it paints this picture that's why I love singing so much it paints this picture of this concept of holding the cross tight as you see literally God's light come down on Earth it makes all of the Shadows flee and all you can about is God God abide with me so for us you know let's realize that we're at the bottom let us realize our deep and strong desire and need for God and once we have that need for God let us look up and raise our eyes towards heaven and let us actually put that scripture in use when it says blessed are the poor in Spirits because we all realize our deep and strong need for God and to God be all the glory e",

    "summary": "The sermon on \"The Beatitudes\" emphasizes the core message of being \"poor in spirit,\" which signifies a complete recognition of one's deep need for God and absolute brokenness before the cross. Through the story of King Nebuchadnezzar, the speaker illustrates how God humbles the proud, forcing them to realize His sovereignty and their own insignificance. The example of the Rich Young Ruler further highlights that outward obedience is not enough; true completeness requires emptying oneself of all pride and possessions to fully follow Christ. The sermon concludes by urging listeners to embrace this humble position, accepting personal challenges to find peace and glorify God.",

        "insight": "The speaker interprets 'blessed are the poor in spirit' and the other Beatitudes as describing individuals who have recognized their absolute nothingness and profound need for God, having surrendered everything to follow Christ. This state of spiritual brokenness means no longer living for oneself but seeking God's answers and a pure heart, regardless of life's persecutions or situations."

        "insight": "The lengthy account of King Nebuchadnezzar's dream and subsequent humbling illustrates that God will forcibly place those who are proud and self-glorifying 'at the bottom' if they do not humble themselves. Nebuchadnezzar's transformation from a boastful king to a beast-like state, and his eventual restoration and glorification of God, serves as a powerful testament to realizing God's supreme sovereignty and one's own dependence on Him."

    "transcript": "let's get right into a lesson let's go to uh Hebrews chapter 11 I have a a lesson for you and we're going to talk a lot about faith today I want to go into a a deep dive on faith and a lot of it is really what I have been trying to grow in my conviction of uh especially as of recently talking about faith uh in Hebrews chap 11 in verse 5 the Bible reads by faith Enoch was taken away and so he did not experience death he was not to be found because God took him away for he was taken away he was a for before he was taken away he was approved as one who pleased God now without faith it is impossible to please God since the one who draws near to him Must Believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him see in this entire chapter it is listed different men of the Bible who had an immense amount of faith and one of these men is of course Enoch and it is a his faith is so outstanding that the Bible says that he was just taken away he pleased God so much with his faith see Faith itself doesn't please God it is needed to begin to please God and he had such an immense amount of faith that he was able to please God so immensely that God just took him you know he's walking I'm not sure what that's like if like he just takes a step and like you know one step he's in Earth and the next step he's like in heaven like I or if it's like he just ascends just gradually like how the clouds cover Jesus I'm not sure what that was like or if he went to sleep and he just woke up one day he's in heaven I have no idea but it just says that his faith in how much he pleased God he was taken away because of it and because we know this that it takes Faith to even begin to please God he pleased god with the founding fact that he knew that he existed and he knew that God rewards those who seek him that is the foundation of where his faith was coming from he was for certain he had confidence he basically had more proof than any physical object could give him that God existed and that he would please him as long as he had faith and uh Enoch pleased him so much because his faith was just that incredible let's look at another passage on Enoch let's go to Genesis 5 we're going to see just how incredible this was in Genesis 5 in verse 21 it says Enoch was 6 5 years old when he followed Methuselah and after he followed Methuselah Enoch walked with God 300 years and father of their sons and daughters so Enoch's life lasted 365 years Enoch walked with God then he was not there because God took him see he walked with God 300 years and then he was no more not because he died not because he was lost but God literally grabbed him he took him and I like to think of it this way you guys uh when I when I think of a really great sports coach a sports coach that is really good doesn't just sit people and bench people when they're doing really bad a really good one will also bench those that are doing really good because he sees their effort he sees their heart he sees how much they're they're sweating how much energy they're putting into the game that if I don't let this person rest then they're going to be worn out before the game ends and they can keep playing so a great coach looks at that he sees the effort and energy says you know what I want you to rest take a few seconds take a breather gather your mind gather your energy so you can go back and continue to give 100% see God is the same way and we know that because literally in the entire Old Testament he talks about you have to rest or I will you will literally die if you don't rest he instituted sabbaths festivals celebrations so that we may know for certain that he rewards those who earnestly seek after him it is evident in his character see God wants us like the coach he wants to have the game be won but because he loves and cares for each and every one of us he also wants us to know that he will reward us if we seek after him that he will give us what we need see um that that is why our faith in God must be so beyond our own expectations it must be so incredible it must be so outstanding that it should be evident in every single step we take see Enoch it was proven that he walked with God literally think about it the author of the New Testament in Hebrews only had this to go off of and with that alone he knew that he walked with God that he pleased God they go hand in hands Faith pleasing God walking with him they go hand in hand so I want us to Deep dive into this kind of Faith this Enoch level Faith this faith that is so immense that literally God could take us and we're striving so hard to have that level of Faith see for for me I I know that I don't have that level of Faith yes sometimes I feel it's very easy to settle with the faith that I have right now it's very easy to think that the way that I am the the my faith right now is enough and I settle for it honestly because I I get kind of scared to reach more faith the idea of having more faith in God I see requires more sacrifice it requires more surrender it it requires me to have such an outstanding belief that I have to accept God more more and the more I accept him the more I leave see I that kind of faith it it comes hard for me to understand but when I think about the world I think about the sins that I so easily commit and the dying world around me I come to a conclusion that God actually doesn't want us to experience this he lets us experience this just like any consequence a a parent doesn't at the end of the day want to give conse quences to their children but they know they need to so they can mature properly God ultimately doesn't want us to experience this he wants us to experience him but we he lets us go through discipline so we can mature enough so we can handle even being in his presence let's go to Exodus chapter 3 see uh this will be the the founding statement for this lesson faith in God doesn't come from wisdom it comes from surrender to grow in your faith does not mean that you must understand him more it means you must surrender more to him in Exodus chapter three we're going to look at Moses see what he did and we're going to go through a chunk of this chapter in verse one meanwhile Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro the priest of Midian he led the flock to The Far Side of the wilderness and came to Horeb the Mountain of God then the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire within a b within a bush as Moses looked he saw that the Bush was on fire but was not consumed Moses thought I must go over look at this remarkable site why isn't the bush burning up when the Lord saw that he had gone over to look God called out to him from the Bush Moses Moses here I am he answered don't come any closer he said remove the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is Holy grounds then he continued I am God I am the god of your an of your father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God see this is amazing faith it starts with Wonder with amazement with curiosity Moses he sees this bush and he's like what the heck is even that and he wants to get close to the bush he wants to understand what's even happening and as he gets closer it says that God looked that Moses uh uh had gone over to look so literally what happened is God put this amazing miracle in front of Moses but it was on Moses to even want to get close to it see faith it starts with that amazement with that child innocent like curiosity and God sees it and then he continues to act to act based off our desire and what's amazing is that as he got close uh it literally said that God told him that take off his sandals God literally said I want you to experience my presence yes this is Holy go ground but I want you to take off your shoes so that you may fully experience this one time when we were in India there's a couple that got married and they got married in this big like Cathedral and part of the cathedral like a section of it was like blocked off and had like a short fence like this tall and it said do not step on because it is Holy Ground and it was like blocked off I'm not sure what made it holy you know I'm not it literally just they built it right but they they have designed it and designated as holy grounds but God doesn't make Holy Ground so that we may avoid it he makes Holy Ground so we may experience it he makes Holy Ground so we may understand what he wants if God is the god that wants us to experience his presence and he rewards us with his presence he wants us to understand and be in that Holy Ground and so that's exactly what Moses did and he understood at that point super clearly that what God rewards us with is not just anything but his presence in that short time of span it went from amazement to hearing God's voice to experiencing his presence in that short span and that was very needed for the next part it says in verse 7 then the Lord said I have observed the misery of my people in Egypt and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors I know about their sufferings and I have come down to rescue them and from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good and spacious land of and a land flowing with milk and honey the territory of the Canaanites the heit the amorites perizzites hivites and jebusites so because the Israelites Cry for Help has come to me and I have also seen the way the Egans are oppressing them therefore go I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you may lead my people the Israelites out of Egypt so now that Moses fundamentally understood that God rewards the those who seek him with his presence he said I am sending you so that my people can experience just what you have experienced they can see just what you see they may feel just what you feel and this is not for you alone Moses this is for all of my people and it's kind of crazy to think about because God wanted to redeem them people want a God that validates them that makes them feel better about themselves people want a God where they can be enlightened have such massive amounts of wisdom people want a God that that helps them understand themselves in the world around them so that they can feel better about themselves they can feel better than other people that is not what God is here for God is here to redeem you God is here to save you from your oppressors he's here to save you from the suffering that either you're inflicting upon yourself maybe you're your own oppressor or from this lost world around you God is here to save you and in verse 11 says but Moses asked God who am I that I should go to pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt see Moses asked what I believe is a very appropriate question he's like God who am I I just came here to look at this bush and all of us sudden you're calling me to lead out two million four million people that is what who am i h how am I qualified and I think that we ask these questions quite constantly God am I really capable am I really capable to help people am I really qualified to to really be like Jesus and I have no credentials I have no qualifications and I I really love God answer it says in verse 12 he answered I will certainly be with you and this will be the sign to you that I am the one who sent you when you bring the people out of Egypt you will all worship God at this mountain see God doesn't even give Moses a time to really answer that question says you're right you're not capable but I am with you I I am why you're capable I am why you are qualified we have zero qualifications on our own merits zero capabilities of what we can accomplish in the likes of what God wants us to accomplish on our own God is the one that qualifies us simply because one fact he decides to be with us he decides to he chooses to we don't make him our faith to please God does not make him decide to be with us he decides that on his very own to be with us and it's really incredible uh because you know uh he says later on he's like I am who I am let's keep reading it says God replied to Moses oh sorry in verse uh 13 then Moses asked God if I go to the Israelites and say to them the god of your ancestors has sent me to you and they ask me what is his name what should I tell them God replied to Moses I am who I am this is what you are to say to the Israelites I am has sent me to you God also said to Moses say this to the Israelites the Lord the god of your ancestors the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob has sent me to you this is my name forever this is how I am to be remembered in every generation you see God is who he is and Moses asked God the same question he just asked himself says God who am I I have no qualifications and God's like you're right but I am with you and then when he tells him that Moses is like but I have to go to these people who do I say that you are God who are you and the reality is it doesn't matter who God is God's answer he doesn't even answer that question he I am who I am and you have to accept that I am not limited to whatever qualifications you might want to come up for me I do not have to give you a resume of what I'm able to do I am exactly who I am and it's funny because we are people that are constantly becoming constantly growing constantly aiming towards something but God is who he already is he is not like a man that must always be becoming he is exactly and he's already who he is and that's good for us because God is not changed and if he is changed then the Bible says we are destroyed but God does not change he is who he is and we have to surrender to that fact we have to surrender to the sole fact that God is exactly who he is and we must have that Mustard Seed of faith in that that faith in his existence and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him but the thing is with that Mustard Seed is that it has to grow it it has to grow and that's why I'm pointing to Enoch that Enoch level faith it has to grow and we think that yes is as long as it's small but a mustard seed it grows it grows into a great mustard tree and Jesus himself God In the Flesh when he sees the Fig tree that's not bearing any fruit he curses it he says may no one eat from you ever again and he goes off with his disciples he comes back with his disciples and they notice God look Jesus the the Fig Tree is withering and the very first thing he says to them have faith have faith yes it might be a tree and yes at some point it grew but then it stopped bearing fruit see faith in God is constantly growing it's constantly proving it l that Enoch was approved because he pleased god with his faith see our faith in God is constantly proving that God is that God is the one that saves us it's evident in The Way We Walk in the way that we talk but we have to be surrendered to the fact that God is who he is God is not limited so we have to stop trying to understand him we have to surrender to him that is our job because if we think we start to know how he does things and why he does things you know how how and why he fixes things how he changes lives how he molds the heart how he gets people to literally repent of their sins and we start to think that we know how he does it then we start to take his place place and believing that we have those same capabilities that I can mold the hearts that I can change people people's lives it's a total lie God is who he is and when we stop trying to surrender to him and we start trying to understand him we start to believe that we can take the place of God the church is not here to take the place of God disciples are not here to take the place of God we are here to uphold God to point people to him to point people to to do things that we cannot make them do only God can make him do and you have to accept that fact you have to surrender to him see I have to remind myself that I'm The Limited one I'm the one that is bound by man-made restrictions and I'm limited to God's word as everyone on planet Earth is we're all limited to God's word and when I tell people that the Bible interprets the Bible especially really religious people they look at me like my head is upside down like like I'm absolutely crazy well because people think different things they think you know it's there's multiple interpretations you know as long as we just love God everyone has their own way of looking at it and we're all okay some people say that the church leaders have the interpretation that is those who God has somehow endowed to be on his Holy Ground well we have to stay back across the fence that's somehow some other people are more holy or more righteous but that's not what my Bible says it says no no one is good no one is more qualified than other people I've heard someone say that the Holy Spirit has the interpretation and this is held up by a number of different denominations I once literally sat in a Bible study where a random guy came up to the both of us and he said you know does this guy is he a Believer is he a Christian I was like no but we're going through it right now he's like then why are you studying the Bible with him he he doesn't have the Holy Spirit he can't understand and I was like but he wants to know and he wants to read the Bible to to see what Jesus says but he can't understand it because he doesn't have the Holy SP like my mind was like where does that like where does that actually come from but people believe that people truly believe that the Bible does not interpret the Bible because the reason why because it's God's word we are not qualified to understand or interpret with our own definitions with our own limitations with our own minds God is the one that knows and he gave us the Bible that we may understand not that we understand in of itself but he lets it interpret itself the Bible interprets the Bible so where does this lead us this idea of having incredible Faith towards God an incredible Faith towards an Incredible God a faith in his existence that is beyond any sort of credibility well I have two points for you the first one is you can love what you do not understand you can love what you do not understand let's go to Ecclesiastes 12 you can love what you do not understand it's one of my favorite books in the Bible and um you know is written by Solomon or many believe is Solomon and you know Solomon in the beginning he says that he denied himself no desire he did everything that his mind and his heart and his Pleasures wanted to do sought after wisdom sought after sin time and time again but he gives us this really astounding conclusion to the life that he lives and Ecclesiastes 12:12 it says but beyond these my son be warned there is no end to the making of many books and much study wearies the body when all has been heard the conclusion of the matter is this fear God and keep his commands Commandments because this is for all Humanity for God will bring Every Act of judgment including every hidden thing whether good or evil so because Solomon wrote this this is straight from the horse's mouth he literally understood one of the most wisest person ever exists and he says honestly guys it all concludes to this fear God and do what he says and this word fear is interesting because the Hebrew word is considered to be in the accusative form so the idea is that you are one who fears not that like you're afraid and like it's like a you know you feel a fear but it's it's a matter of who you are one who is in awe of God in a constant state of being just constantly in awe of God and then you do what he says and I think it's very interesting because it's actually super simple um and that we can love can be in awe of something that we do understand I'll break it down this way I extremely love my wife I really love my wife I very much love my wife and in that sometimes she does things that I don't understand and I'll literally say to myself why should why would she do that not because it was good or bad but I just fundamentally just don't understand where she's coming from and I find this the more that I dig into that question question why does she do this the more unspiritual I get the more frustrated I get the more impatient I get not because of what she did but because of my own desire to understand the source of what she was doing I frustrate myself and in the opposite sense when I sto trying to understand her and I start trying to learn from her I feel a lot more happy I feel a lot Morey piece and what do I mean by understand versus learn from in one sense understand is like why is she doing this why would she do this I don't understand it ver just like okay I'm going to accept the fact something like she likes to go for walks I'm not going to dig into why I will never understand why you know you come home like ah sit down let's go for a walk like why you know uh I should I need to stop asking that question and said okay she likes to go for walks boom accepted how can I choose to love her in What She Likes what kind of walks does she likes does she like around nice big buildings old history and architecture does she like in in parks with nature with music no music and that's learning from her and once I stopped trying to understand her then I can truly learn from her and actually love her the way she wants to be loved it's the same way with God we have to stop trying to understand why understand how and where he's coming from and just learn from him just surrender to the fact that he is who he is and I guarantee you you will be a lot more spiritual and a lot less frustrated with this life uh every time I meet someone who doesn't really believe in God they have a slight anger to them a slight frustration because there is some facts that they cannot wrap their mind around because they have to stop trying to wrap their mind around it it doesn't work no one can do it and we do it with people we do it with children we literally look at children and we have zero clue what's going on in their heads like I will give Anna a spoon and she knows how to use it she'll take a bite with eating yogurt and then she'll take she'll literally grab yogurt with her hands with and have the spoon still in her other hand her right hand will be totally clean and her left hand is just endowed in yogurts and every now and then after a few bites she might go back to this SP I I I should never try to understand why she does that it is an endless road that leads to absolutely nowhere but man I do love Anna even with all her quirks so we do it with people we can do it with God we can love what we do not understands let's go to Romans 11 we have to stop trying to fit God in a box to understands see God is and he wants us to be who he needs us to be he wants us to be who he wants us to be and we can serve God we can be there for him we can love God even when we do not understand him in Romans chapter 11 it says uh at the very end here in verse 33 this is a song that they would sing uh oh the depth and the of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God how unsearchable his judgments how untraceable his ways for who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor oh man and who has ever given to God that he should be repaid for from him and through him and to him are all things to him be the glory forever amen see to worship God is simply surrendering to the fact that he is who he is that he is The Great I Am and that's all we have to we have to surrender to that not try to understand him be his counselor be the ones who speak instead of him but he already speaks which leads me to the last point the second point which is Jesus the one we can understand see God didn't leave us to run like chickens with our head cut off with our with our pain our suffering and the world around us he actually does want us to understand the small little semblance in which our human minds are capable of grasping he wants us to grasp him and that's why he came down in human form to where our minds could understand at least the parts that we need to understand and it's amazing and that is why Jesus is the Living Word he is God In the Flesh God gave us a way to understand what we can understand so that we may live in Philippians chapter 3 we'll close out here and so I I apologize I S have said my lesson simply is The Great I Am that's the title The Great I Am uh in Philippians chapter 3 point number two Jesus the one we can understand in Philippians 3 the Bible reads in verse 10 my goal is to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being conformed to his death assuming that I will somehow reach the resurrection from among the dead see Jesus being God In the Flesh The Living Word a way that God has allowed us to understand the parts that we need to understand for how to live literally the Bible and like Paul knowing Christ has to be our mission because we can know him and it's amazing it literally says my goal is to know him and the power of his resurrection what Jesus went through literally him surpassing life going back to that what we said in the beginning God rewards those who earnestly seek him he wants to understand that reward to know that reward and the second thing is the fellowship the the partaking the participating in Jesus's sufferings being conformed being molded being shaped to his death see this is the goal of Our Lives to understand Jesus in a way where we live like him where it is proof that not only do we live like him but we will die like him die the way that he died and it's powerful and I want to ask you guys this question have you suffered the way Christ suffered do you suffer for the same reasons that Christ suffered see he suffered for his friends for his family for his loved ones for the disciples around him for the non- disciples who might have only heard him one time then walked away see Christ suffered and we have have to participate in those same sufferings or we will never understand him and it would be such a shame to not understand him when that was the reason why he came down that was the whole point of his word that we may understand and not put an understanding to our minds but let it speak to us we must go and live and suffer the way that Christ has suffered and I know for me that I'm I fall short I fall short in making this my ultimate goal will I strive for every single day sometimes I like to settle in my suffering and I know I'm settling in my suffering because I'm settling in the level of faith that I want to have but even though I know I fall short I know I I don't make this my goal I will do everything in my power to make it my goal to make make it the my whole mission for being here to know Christ and his sufferings and I Will Not Waste what God has allowed me to understand so we have to fight to know him we have to fight to understand him we have to suffer the way that he suffered we have to live the way that he lived because he has granted us that so we might understand the small semblance of God that he has allowed us to understand and it would be such a shame to let that go to waste so we should literally make it our mission to walk with God the same way that Enoch did because he has literally made a way for us to do this to walk with God and because there is a God that we cannot understand we have to actually believe wholeheartedly in his existence and the fact that he rewards those who seek him and just because we cannot understand him I'm grateful that he's actually allowed us to have way where we could understand him and we have to make it our mission to know Jesus to know what he's gone through and to make that our lives even though we cannot understand God I'm so grateful that he has allowed us to understand his son and what he's experienced and so let us serve and love the god that we don't understand and give ourselves holy to his son in which we can understand and to God be all the glory for",

    "summary": "The sermon, titled \"The Great I Am,\" explores the nature of profound faith, using Enoch's pleasing walk with God and Moses' encounter at the burning bush as key examples. It posits that true faith stems from surrender to God rather than a complete understanding of Him, emphasizing His existence and His rewarding of those who seek Him. While acknowledging God's unsearchable ways, the message highlights Jesus as the comprehensible manifestation of God, urging believers to make it their mission to know Christ and participate in His sufferings to truly understand Him.",

        "insight": "This passage introduces 'Enoch level faith,' stating that Enoch pleased God so immensely with his faith that God took him away without him experiencing death. The speaker explains that faith is essential to please God, requiring belief in His existence and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him."

        "verse": "Genesis 5:21-24",
        "insight": "This record of Enoch's life, particularly that he 'walked with God 300 years' and 'God took him,' is interpreted as a reward for his unwavering faith. The sermon likens God to a coach who sees effort and provides rest, demonstrating God's care and desire to reward those who diligently commit themselves to Him."

        "verse": "Exodus 3:1-15",

    "transcript": "today you know I haven't had the full experience of getting to fully know everyone and over the next days months prayerfully years I want to get in every single one of your guys' lives and I think it would be amazing because I would love to preach from the standpoint of that preach from the standpoint of how can we together collectively knowing what we need to work on build ourselves build God's church but as this is my first time preaching I can't fully get into this I would love to preach on what values God has taught me I I I would love to preach on today what is importantance to me uh let's go to John chapter one I will I will share a bit about my experience in John chap 1 says in verse 10 the Bible reads he was in the world and the world was created through him and yet the world did not recognize him he came to his own and his own people did not receive him but to all who did receive him he gave them the right to be children of God to whose to to those who believe in his name uh who were who were born not of natural descent or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man but of God see God who created the massive infinite expanding Universe literally thinking about that my mind can't even fathom that here you have a universe that we cannot measure the amount of galaxies and it's growing it is literally a space within an infinite amount of space I cannot even picture what that looks like yet within that there is Millions upon millions of galaxies in that millions of galaxies we are in one called the Milky Way where you have all these millions upon billions of stars and for most of these stars there are solar systems like the one that we have where our Earth is rotating around the Sun and so literally there are an innumerable amount of planets out in the universe and yet God looks at us and he came down in human form but he came down in human form and we did not receive him we did not accept him see I imagine it like you know ever see a dog that has been traumatized that's been hurts and you see the video of someone trying to help that dog and and but the dog feels nothing but fear and it's wailing and it's screaming because it recognized every single hand that reaches to Ed as a threesh you see we are like that dog you see similar to a deer in the forest the deer it is so used to constantly being hunted by prey constantly on the run that just the sound of a snapping twig it takes off it has no time to think of what is making that sound it just takes off because it is so used to being hunted we are like that deer you know I think one of the saddest phenomenons in our world is uh people developing Alzheimer resistance the the idea of forgetting a loved one but even worse being that loved one and seeing the person in front of you forget who you are and sometimes even feel a sense of fear because you're doing your best a person is doing their best I've known you my entire life you giv birth to me and they're like I have no idea who you are you're terrified get out of my house see that is exactly where we get did to Jesus we did not accept it and you know God came down because of our hurt our fear our pain and ultimately our sin but we didn't even recognize him we had no idea his intentions and not only that when he wanted us to embrace him we didn't receive him and we killed him we beat him and we left him to hang on a cross see well the thing that I found very valuable to me that I want to preach on is simply receiving God my my title for us today is just receiving God we I want to be a man that wants and desires very deeply to receive God see this is actually uh my my favorite passage in the Bible um and I find it sometimes hard to preach on because thinking about it like my mind can't even can't even process what that's like I can't imagine me trying to you know give love to Anna one day you know I want to help treat her out to a dinner or something and then suddenly she wanted to S me I can imagine the pain that God felt but why is this my favorite passage honestly it makes me very indignant it makes me indignant about my situation um you know I actually was first baptized quote unquote when I was 13 years old but I don't think personally that I really knew what I was doing um and after about a year I decided just to walk away from God I I I decided that I would rather live in my own sin it's a lot easier it's a lot more comfortable and I decided to go that route and for five years I knew that if I died I would go to hell and I chose for five years to do nothing about this um simply because I loved my sin I I loved being selfish I love being prideful I loved watching pornography I I love doing all the things that got me nowhere near to God and uh the reality is that I thought that if I could do these things enough knowing that I would go to hell that I would feel enough security feel enough Comforts feel enough pleasure that I would somehow be convinced that it would work somehow be convinced that I could find peace outside of God but the reality is I was doing it because I was scared to face who I truly was I I was scared to face the the Malik that was weak the Malik that's insecure the Malik has zero control over his life situations and that if I could just drown myself in in in total vanity I would never have to deal with that ever again but yet for five years I still knew that Malik existed I still knew that deep down that I'm just trying to cover that up and whenever I read this passage it gets me in indignant about those five years you know um my first point for you is simply be indignant being indignant is very valuable to me I know that if I'm not indignant in the moment at any given moment of the day that there is something wrong you know kind of like when you're leaving the the to get out the house and you you know something's missing typically something extremely important for what you're trying to do like your wallet or your keys you know but you you you can't figure fig out so you're walking slowly to the car hoping you can figure it out before you get there and not waste that whole trip down the stairs you know that that's what it should be like when we forget that we're indignant because we're not going to get to where we're trying to go unless we have it we need to be indignant I need to be indignant for me at least when I'm not indignant I am operating off of on autopilot right I I'm operating solely back to what I used to do and just live in pure apathy live as if discipleship is just routine and I'm not just talking about I'm talking about right now as a disciple you know for me when I uh uh try to speak and do lessons I want to be as vulnerable as I can with you guys uh because it helps keep me in check that that I am in the same position as everyone else here just trying to seek God and so for me that is one of my struggles is not being indignant so I have to Value being indignant the the word indignation uh the English trans translation of the Greek only actually appears one time in that 2 Corinthians 7 when it talks about Godly sorrow it says you know what longing What Fear what what what eagerness to do what is right and the CSD says what indignation and that's the noun the verb actually is uh pronounced in the Greek uh Aon agono and and it's the combination of two words uh first is a which means much and second is ose which means grief being indignant means much grief when you look at your life and how you put Jesus on the cross the sins that you constantly are tempted with the idea of Towing the line finding the bare minimum to do in your discipleship do you feel grief over those thoughts I know I do the the the thought of me even thinking about my past life makes me extremely obsessed because I know if I Linger on that thought I can very easily go back to it I'm not above it and I know none of us else are above it so I have to stay indous see when you fall short when you see all the ways that you sin do do you ask yourself do you cry out to God God what is happening why does this keep happening me why why I keep thinking that these having these terrible thoughts in my head why do I keep Desiring my old life do you get indignant about those thoughts let's go to Exodus chapter 16 expand on this bit I only have two points indignation I believe you are very important for Desiring God at least for me in Exodus chapter 16 the Bible reads in verse one the entire Israelite Community departed from elim and came to the Wilderness of sin which is between elim and Si on the 15th day of the second month uh after they had left the land of Egypt the entire Israelite Community grumbled against Moses and Aaron excuse me in the wilderness the Israelites said to them if only we had died by the Lord's hand in the land of Egypt when we sat by pots of meat and ate all the bread we wanted instead you brought us into this Wilderness to make this whole assembly die of hunger then the Lord said to Moses I am going to reain bread from heaven for you the people are going out each day are to go out each day and gather enough for that day this way I will test them to see whether or not they will follow my instructions see Time After Time After Time the Israelites the people who are supposed to be God's people constantly complain to Moses and Aaron the people who were guiding them out of slavery and here they are again turning to them saying we wish we had died by God's hand because at least back then we were comfortable we had pots of meat all the bread that we can eat but here's actually the funny thing about that passage it's a total lie they did not have possib they did not have endless bread like all of them they did not have that option they were slaves and they were worked like slaves here's what happens when we're not indignant about and we don't have grief and sorrow over the sins that we commit we start to think that our past life was easier than our current discipleship we have to be very careful to be a greess see the Israelites they forgot their life how hard it was as slaves and they accepted that and they believed that life was easier as slaves because there's no way it can be as hard as the challenge of Walking with God and they were convinced so by Satan I I'll speak for myself like in my discipleship in Ministry in life see I I've experienced that thinking things like God can I really do this right am I really someone that you want to work with is discipleship really the path to peace I hope I'm not the only one that struggles with that from time to time but this is how Satan Works he doesn't just want you to doubt he wants you to look back fondly and think lightly of your sin of your past life and here's the point about indignation you have to hate whatever you have those thoughts see don't you hate it when you're desensitized to sin when you start the second guess is sin really that bad can I re can I Lally do can I do a little bit of it and kind of get away with it don't you hate when you have those thoughts see don't you hate it when you start to be convinced that discipleship is routine that somehow it's boring it's the same thing every single day and don't you hate it when when you start to have these thoughts that are totally not true because you know that in the world has nothing to offer but you still think these thoughts see I know that I do and I know that I need to be indignant see I I think about this that we have to be indignant because we made the decision to become disciples and literally stand opposed to Satan it is Satan's job to make us desensitized to a Christian lifestyle it is Satan's job to make us feel like sin wasn't really that bad and so whenever you have that thoughts recognize that is the time that you have to be the most passionate about your walk with God that's the time you have to be the most passionate about how you have to live your life with God not just by your actions but how you think as well you have to be indignant from the inside out about your Temptations about your doubts about your compl complacency because Satan does not want you to be passion about God but once you're indignant about your life you feel much grief about the things that you've done then you can finally Worship in spirit and Truth amen uh another thing that I find super passionate uh for me at least uh I think is extremely important is very simply Desiring God I I think that one cannot live discipleship until the day until the day that they die unless they truly desire ire God and I think sometimes there are other things that in the Kingdom we could desire more than God we can desire relationships we can desire fruitfulness you know we we could desire feeling good being praised by other disciples encouragements but there is nothing that we should desire more than seeing God I I strongly believe that I know that you guys do too otherwise you wouldn't be here that the world needs God the world not just needs to know God the world needs to desire him and long for him deeply not just a surface level relationship with God getting by every Sunday doing the absolute bare minimum but constantly Desiring what can I do more for God the world needs that otherwise they're doing more for themselves doing more for their ego their sense of self- accomplishments and it just leads them down the same path to Absolute nothing see we need to desire God I can uh ashamedly admit there's been times in my discipleship when I haven't desired that when when when I feel absolutely defeated you know when uh Natalie and I alongside my parents um and another pair of disciples we spent about a year in India on the on the FL Mission field and our job there was just to be the disciples be a part of the church there and we literally you know at Le for us we gave if not sold our stuff and chose to live in India not thinking that we were coming back anytime soon in fact the day that we were told to come back um I had just put down a down deposit for our apartment but we were in a different Church in India and so I called saying hey you know I can't pick up the KE pick up the keys and then this is what I heard back on the phone well you're actually going back to a and I was like I just put down a massive deposit I'm going back to America with no money that that was my thoughts but it was a total surprise to me but the situation with in India honestly it caused me to desire God less now I'll tell you guys why after leaving India we had found out that certain disciples chose and made excuses and made up excuses not to come share with us so that we can be discouraged that we might leave India sooner that was the situation that we were in and honestly we felt this we felt the discouragements we felt like nothing was working um one one time uh a brother who I had uh confronted and I was sharing with him bro I believe that you're telling me about a situation that I didn't even hear that that's gossip and is in between you know Church leers meeting about an hour after and he started screaming in my face like bro you're a leer you need to know how could you call yourself this you are a terrible example and there's like tons of people around us and I felt embarrassed I felt belittled and I knew in that moment that no word I can say could actually calm down the situation so I just said amen but I've known this you know brother this disciple for a number of years U and I'm actually super grateful now the churches in India are thriving and I I I am nothing but grateful the fact that God allows everyone to have repentance a and how could I not want that for them as well and even that brother uh he has shown great repentance amen um but but in the moment it was terrible and so when we come back along with many other similar situations when we come back to America what I felt was that nothing worked and God was against me that that's what I felt and so I lived discipleship very simply out of Duty I did Ministry simply out of Duty for the next few months and what I desired truly was just to escape from it I I desired to find ways to to drown that thought that God doesn't want me here God's people don't want me here and I wanted to escape I wanted to run from that you know and coming back to America I was convinced I was convinced that I was a bad disciple I was convinced I was terrible at ministering and I was convinced that I was even the worst husband to my wife but um there there's one bump in the road that God allowed and it was Natalie being pregnant and um and I am I'm very grateful because I believe God was trying to wake me up in that moment too you know I had a daughter on the way and I knew that if I didn't get my act straight when she was born that I feel like it was done for me if I couldn't do it for that reason I could have do it and uh you know our daughter anise her her her name is God is myel and when she was born I I was breaking out in tears and I knew that I have to be a better man now I have to start Desiring God more than I've ever desired him before and I that was my own I did whatever it took I told myself I will do whatever it takes to desire God more than I ever have in my entire life in my entire discipleship no matter how little sleep I get because when you have a newborn baby you will have very little sleep no matter how little sleep I get uh no no matter if if people want to encourage me or not I will do whatever it takes to desire God every single day and um I want to go to Psalm chapter 27 and because that I've reached that low because God has allowed me to reach that I told myself I will never go back to that again I want to receive God one day I've already spent most of my life rejecting him I now have to receive him but in order to receive him I have to desire him I think the reason why many people didn't recognize Jesus is because they weren't looking for him they weren't looking for a way out they weren't looking for a Savor and so for us to receive him we have to strongly and deeply desire in Psalm chapter 27 we'll we'll close out here says in verse one the Lord is my light in my salvation whom should I fear the lord is the stronghold of My Life whom should I dread when evildoers came against me to devour My Flesh my foes and my enemies stumbled and fell though an Army deploys against me my heart will not be afraid though a war breaks out against me I will still be confident I have asked one thing from the Lord it is what I desire to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life gazing on the beauty of the Lord and seeking him in his Temple you see all we have to do is desire God we have to seek God in the very first scripture we look at you know I I love doing the Bible studies because it convicts me you look at one scripture you're like man I better be doing this but I better want the do this as well otherwise I can help nobody I can't even help myself Desiring God is what I believe I need the most because if I lose my desire for God I lose everything I lose being a good husband I lose being a good father I lose being a good friend I lose everything I have to desire God and I know that we're all here because we all we all want to desire God where we are literally here in this room so we can learn to do more for God and I pray that we can keep doing that and I'm super excited to desire God with all of you guys I'm super excited to seek God with all of you guys I love the kingdom I love being around disciples if someone told me there were extra meetings in the body I would still go to there you know like literally like my my wife and I will talk you're like bab like you know we have baby now I'm like yeah but like you can come with us you know like we can do all these cool things you know but I literally love around disciples and so I'm super excited to desire God with all of you guys but more so we have the desire to be in the house of the Lord desire to seek his face to see his Beauty that's what matters most and if we can desire God if we can be indignant have grief be ashamed of the life that we've lived so that one day we can receive God in glory I believe God can do anything through us there is nothing that he won't be willing to do all we have to do is stand with him and therefore we receive him it's To God Be Glory",

    "summary": "Malik Speckman's sermon, \"Receiving God,\" encourages believers to cultivate two key attitudes: indignation against sin and a deep desire for God. Sharing his personal journey of falling away and returning, he explains that true indignation involves feeling profound grief over past sins and present temptations, rejecting complacency. He contrasts this with the Israelites' grumbling and false nostalgia for their past slavery, warning against Satan's attempts to desensitize disciples to sin. Ultimately, the sermon calls for an unwavering, passionate desire for God above all else as the foundation for a purposeful and consistent walk with Him, enabling one to truly receive God.",

    "transcript": "amen well thank you for that uh thank you so much Jared for allowing me to uh preach this morning um you know I'm really grateful I was praying a few days ago and I was just wrestling in my own heart about my own life uh and this phrase came in my mind of you know take hold of your life that was kind of the phrase and I know that's something that uh that Paul says in the Bible uh and and so I just that started me on this journey to kind of study this out uh and so the title of my lesson this morning is take hold of your life uh I think it's something that uh for everybody in this room uh is is a a challenging thing sometimes to do is to take hold of of your own life and make decisions for your life for your betterment uh sometimes that can be difficult to do uh but I think that it's something that we all are faced with and and are forced to kind of make decisions uh or or not make decisions uh in bettering Our Lives and I think to do it God's way is obviously always the right way uh come on King this King right here you help me with my lesson um and so a little bit about me uh my first service at the IC uh was actually in April 8th of 2007 uh I actually wasn't looking to see God at all at the time uh but my dad had kind of forced me to come and uh because he was getting restored and so I was there you know sitting in the back not really wanting to be there or talk to anybody uh but I I saw my dad get restored and it just so happened to be the same day that Jared got baptized and and so I got to see him go up on stage and uh you know weep a little bit and uh give his good confession that Jesus is Lord and then get baptized so it was really cool to see that I was 20 years old at the time and I had just spent the past two years really pursuing the world with my whole heart and getting into as much sin as I possibly could uh but of course after the service the brothers came and asked me to study the Bible which I rejected uh and it took a few more months of me really pursuing sin until God brought me really to my Rock Bottom where I was finally willing to meet up with the guys and study the Bible uh and so it was it was in October of that year that I did study the Bible uh and made my good confession was baptized by Jared and my dad October 28 amen and you know one of the things I understood when I studied the Bible and made the decision to get baptized uh was that I I truly had to let go of my life of sin uh in order to take hold of the Salvation that God was offering me I I had to truly let go and I made some radical decisions to let go of some relationships let go of some connections some paraphernalia whatever I let go of everything that was uh hindering me in my relationship with God in order to take hold of this salvation that was being offered I understood that I couldn't have both uh which actually is very contrary to what a lot of the religious World teaches they teach hey just say pray you're good you can you can do whatever you want uh turn your Bible to First Timothy chapter 6 1 Timothy 6 starting in verse 11 Bible says but you man of God flee from all this and pursue righteousness godliness Faith love endurance and gentleness fight the good fight of the faith take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses in the sight of God who gives life to everything and of Christ Jesus who while testifying before pontious Pilate made the good confession I charge you to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which God will bring about in his own time god the blessed and only ruler the king of kings and Lord of lords who alone is Immortal and who lives in unapproachable light whom no eye has seen nor can see to him be honor in might forever and the church said amen you know I love uh the verbs that are used used in verse 11 and 12 uh he says to flee from the world and to pursue what is good uh and we know this as repentance right when we when we're studying the Bible we understand that we have to do a 180 in our lives to turn away from the world and run towards God and that's not just something we do at baptism it's something we do for the rest of our lives amen and then he says to fight for your faith uh and I have a question for you this morning are you still fighting for your faith are you fighting for your relationship with God it is a fight and if you're not in the battle then you're going to die spiritually uh and I know there's been times in my life where I'm man I just I haven't fought in a while uh I've kind of surrendered to the enemy a little bit uh and if if that's where you're at I encourage you to get back up and fight again fight to have spend time with God fight to to spend time in prayer in the word uh fight for your friends and your family uh it's worth it help each other to to get back in the battle uh we need one another in this fight and then finally he says to take hold of eternal life uh in the NLT it says to hold tightly uh and I love this imagery for me because we understand if you're holding on to something super tight that implies that you've let go of everything else uh that there's nothing else you can hold on to but whatever you're holding on to tightly uh and I believe that this is the call this morning is that God wants you to to forsake everything else in your life and hold tightly onto what he has to offer onto the life that God has intended for you uh and it's really uh kind of two steps first you have to analyze kind of where you're at and like man maybe there are things that I'm holding on to that I probably should let go of and that's the first kind of step to realize okay once I let go of the things that I shouldn't be holding on to then I'm free now to hold on what God has to offer uh and I really do believe that God has very special plans for everybody in this room uh and if you don't believe me just read Jeremiah 29 uh verse 11-14 it says that God has a plan for your life to prosper you and not to harm you to give you hope in a future do you believe that amen thank you we got one one believer amen all amen but the truth is that God is offering you something greater than any person or anything can possibly offer you in this life and in eternal life but you have to let go whatever the world is offering in order to take hold of what God is offering amen uh so Point number one is Drop It Like It's [Applause] Hot the first step you gotta you got to drop whatever you're holding on to that God doesn't want you to hold on to and Drop it like it's hot I don't know what that means what exactly Hot Potato there you go exactly uh but you know one of my favorite things to do when I'm studying the Bible is uh to use this app called the Blue Letter Bible uh and and it allows you to study out specific words to understand like kind of the the origin the Greek or the Hebrew or whatever uh and you know one of the favorite words that really has kind of changed my life uh it's pronounced aam and the definition of it is to send away to let go to let alone let be to give up keep no longer forgive uh and there's more and more you know definitions uh you can study it out the very first time that it's used is actually in Matthew 3 where John the Baptist is arguing with Jesus because he doesn't think it's right that he baptized him it's like no this is doesn't make sense this isn't how it should be and then it says Jesus says let it be uh in other words it's like Let It Go bro and and then it says that John relented and it's the same word a he said he let it go uh and you know for us this can be challenging we have to surrender to what God's plan is for our lives even when we don't understand it and we're like no it shouldn't be this way and God's just like Let It Go bro let it go it's this is how it's going to be and the longer we try to take control of things and control things that we can't control the the worse our life is going to be and God just wants us to let it go and and let let life happen as as God intended it to happen let go of control of things we can't control and then in the next chapter of Matthew chapter 4 uh it says that Jesus Calls the first disciples and it says they Dro their Nets to follow him it's the same word a FEI they let go and we understand as disciples that in order to follow Jesus we have to let go of everything in order to follow Jesus uh and so that's what it did that's that's that's a let go and then it's used in chapter six of Matthew where Jesus says if you forgive others their sin then God will forgive you yours but if you don't forgive others then God won't forgive you this word forgive is the same as let go uh and so Jesus is saying hey if you hold on to people sin when they when they sin against you if you hold on to the bitterness to unforgiveness if you don't let it go then guess what God's not going to let it go when you sin I don't know about you that's super convicting um you know I was super inspired last week when the Four Brothers got up here and preached the Book of Jonah uh it's one of my favorite books uh in the Bible and one of my favorite passages from there is in chapter 2 verse 7 where he's in the fish and praying and he says when my life was ebing away I remembered you Lord and my prayer Rose to you to your Holy Temple those who cling to worthless Idols turn away from God's love for them uh in the 84 version says Those Who cling to worthless Idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs uh and so if you just think about you know what are the things that you're holding on to that you know you probably shouldn't the truth is that they're they're worthless Idols uh and and it's always worth it to let it go so that you can take hold of of God's plan for your life and so what happens what happens when you decide to hold on what happens when you decide to not let go of those things uh and hold on to what God isn't intending for you to hold on to we'll look in Revelation chapter 3 Revelations 3 starting in ver well start not Revelations Revelation chapter 3 starting at verse 15 you know this is actually directly from Jesus to the church and OA and in verse 15 he says I know your Deeds that you are neither cold nor hot I wish you were either one or the other so because you are lukewarm neither hot nor hold I'm about to spit you out of my mouth you say I'm rich I've acquired wealth I don't need a thing but you do not realize that you are wretched pitiful poor blind and naked I cancel you I have some advice for you buy from me gold refined in the fire so that you can become rich and white clothes to wear so that you can cover your shameful nakedness and Sal to put on your eyes so that you can see those whom I love I rebuke and discipline so be Earnest and repent uh you know this is will always be one of the most convicting scriptures for me um and what was really the issue with this church is that they had become comfortable uh they had become comfortable in their sin and and were relying on things other than God and I love it because Jesus has some advice he's like hey here's my my counseling I advise you to come and and make a purchase from me you know it's kind of interesting that that we can purchase something from Jesus uh and he says that things that I have to offer that are for purchase are Faith Purity and vision uh and and it's cool to think about that this isn't just this is offer to anybody but there's a cost to it uh in other words you have to let go of something in order to take hold of what God has in store uh and I think this is these are things we all want but but it comes at a cost are you willing to pay the price are you willing to get a little uncomfortable in in order to truly have faith in order to truly have Purity in your life in order to truly be able to see what God's plan is for you you got to get a little uncomfortable sometimes uh you know there's a difference between sinning and being comfortable with your sin you know you got to ask yourself this morning what what sins are you comfortable with uh I think we all have sins that like oh for sure no I'm not I'm not going to do that but then there might be some maybe heart sins that we just like it ain't that bad but it's those sins that will actually destroy your life uh you know I know for me I remember a time in my life where I was really comfortable with the sin of bitterness uh and for me I was very I was very I was aware of it I knew that I'm better at this person this person this person you know uh I mean of course when I'm talking about the people I probably I wouldn't say that necessarily but you know my wife knows you know I'm like oh oh this person's going to be there oh I don't want to go you know I would tell her straight up uh so she knew but but not not but I was very comfortable with it because I I felt entitled to it I felt like these PE and these people like really did things that hurt me and legitimately and I had my reasons and I could tell you why um but the truth is it was only destroying me it was destroying my my wife she saw it it was destroying the people that I was close to me uh and and and you know that person who knows what they were doing living their life and I'm here bitter um and I remember when I when I finally was confronted with it like by God um and and I was like man I need I knew I needed to to deal with it initially I was like I don't know how like yeah okay I want to deal with it but how do I do it and I had to really fight I had to get uncomfortable I had to to to figure it out and then I I realized it was actually this word of Fe in me that I had to let it go I had to let it go I had to forgive these people not meaning like I forgive you like it's like no no I had to let it go that's what forgiveness means um and I remember I remember this process it was scary you know one thing about being comfortable with sin is even though you realize it's wrong the the thought of letting it go actually could be scary because at least it's familiar at least we know what it's like and to get rid of it it's like man this is this is this is daunting the past but it's always worth it when you let go of of of sin to take hold of your relationship with God it's always worth it and the Bible says that when you repent times of refreshing will come uh and that's what I experienced you know uh one of the things that I'm just going to be a little honest right now that I I'm I have to decide to let go of is fear uh you know of course there's there's new leaders coming into town right um and Sam and I have gone through this many many times um and to my my own shame I there's been times where people have come in and I haven't even given them a chance my heart is like no I like my old leaders better and and I'm mad that this is happening and and I I wasn't surrendered to what God was doing and so I I just I made the situation bad um and and it never turns out well you know and so for me it's like no no no I'm not going to hold on to fear this time I'm gonna let it go and I'm GNA trust God and I I totally believe everything is going to be fine God's totally in control um and so you know I just encourage you to to search your own heart and see like man what are the things that that you're holding on to uh we shouldn't be comfortable with sin you know uh I'm gonna list a few sins here and and I want you to after I I when I give you the signal I want you to say drop it like a to you know we live in America uh I I believe America was built on the sin of greed you know what greed is Right greed is when you desire more than what you need that's greed uh and so what are we going to do with greed come on how about how about debauchery how about the sin of Envy unforgiveness laziness faithlessness amen and I believe when we when we do this we will we will be freeing ourselves when we drop these things it's going to feel amazing or like amen now I can live life now I can go forward amen amen all right Point number two is you have to be bold and take hold you have to be courageous to take hold of Life uh look at Hebrews chapter 4 come on thank you Hebrews 4 starting at verse 14 Bible reads therefore since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven Jesus the son of God let us hold firmly to the faith we profess for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are yet he did not sin Let Us approach God's throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find Grace to help us in our time of need you know one of the things that I teach my kids uh and I and I and more and more as they were growing up is that I'm always okay when they blow it I'm always okay when they make mistakes even if they deliberately go against the rules I I I I will always be willing to forgive I will always be willing to reason but I I want them to be able to approach me with confidence to know that I'm going to forgive them to know that I'm going to love them no matter what I never want them to be afraid to approach me with their mistakes with when they belong us um and I believe that's that's God's heart towards us is that God wants us to be able to approach his throne with confidence not in our own righteousness now we're not confident because I we never blew it because but we're confident that God's gonna love us no matter what that when we have a heart that's humble and willing to change and willing to learn from our mistakes willing to admit when we blow it God's right there it's like I forget all right you learned a lesson let's go let's move forward but when we're not confident in that in that and we feel like we're we're unsure of our relationship with God then it's going to prevent us from really approaching the very source of our salvation the very source of forgiveness and God wants us to be confident not in our own righteousness but in in God's love um and so once we amen Drop It Like It's Hot and and get rid of all the the baggage in our lives what that's going to do is it's going to free us to allow us to to live the life that God wants us to live and what does that really mean what's the practical application of that it's going to allow us to make decisions it's going to allow us to decide to to move move forward uh and make decisions you know there's a quote by Winston Churchill that says Perfection is the enemy of progress uh and and what does that mean that means that when you're so afraid to make a decision without knowing for sure that this is the perfect decision to make then we won't make a decision but but that's that's that's called indecision and that's going to ruin your life it will only delay the inevitable and another another quote is that more as lost by indecision then wrong decision indecision is the thief of opportunity it will still you blind you know I'll never forget uh living in New York City and when you know Sam and I have been dating for a little over a year we broke up uh she broke up with me and it was the right [Applause] decision yeah yeah she that's what she did yep that's true um but I remember uh really struggling because I wanted to move back to California right away um but I I was scared because like if I moved to California then I was essentially just giving up that we could ever get back together um and so I stayed for that reason for a little bit but then eventually I was like man this is not good I I'm I'm dying spiritually and you know I still I I still want there to be hope in that relationship but it's not worth giving up my relationship with God and so I just was was but I was stuck in indecision I didn't know what to do and then I remember actually going to Jared Mel's wedding in DC and that's where I had this talk with Jack uh and uh and I I was just sharing with him you know my my you know struggle and he's like bro just make a decision it's like and it seemed like such a you know whatever like what is he talking about it sounds so obvious but then when I walked away from the conversation I was like yeah I just have to make a decision why am I gost to make a decision and then he's like if you make a decision then you find out it's like a bad decision then we make another decision there's always that decision to be made and you know that's kind of like the famous his famous words there but for me it's it's really what helped me to to get out of this indecision uh and I believe that this is what's guided me throughout my life up into this point and allowed you know even my wife and I to make a lot of hard decisions uh but better that than being stuck in indecision um and you know my encouragement to you is you just you can't be afraid to live life you can't be afraid to move forward you can't be afraid to take risks take chances you have to be bold and take hold of this life that God has given you um you know Scarlet uh just recently thank God got out of her Taylor Swift face um but you know there was one song uh that that I actually like from there the the song is called anti-hero that was the but you know in the chorus of the song she She says uh it's like it's me hi I'm the problem it's me uh and then she says I'll stare directly into the Sun but never into the mirror and let me tell you something when you fail to take hold of a life God is trying to give you guess what it's you yes you're the problem it's you and and the truth is we got to stop blaming circumstances and other people for all our problems if only my husband would help around the house if only my my wife which is stop being so critical I wish I had a better discip nobody understands my situation maybe I'm the only one that has these STS I don't know you got to stop beating yourself up and telling yourself W I'm just not good enough I can't do anything right I might as well just give up like it's not going to get you where you want to go instead you have to take control of of your life start making decisions to better yourself what do you want to do this year maybe you want to lead a Bible talk maybe maybe you have an interest and you want to start dating you know I'll tell you another story I remember when I had an interest in Sam uh and I found out it was Mutual I was like okay surely the leadership is they know it's mutual of course they're just going to make it happen right and I was waiting around and nothing was happening and then I got some advice from a wise man he's like bro no one's going to live your life for you you got to make it happen and that's the truth no one's going to live your life for you make it happen make some decisions make a plan maybe you maybe you want to have deeper convictions and really know your Bible better no one's going to live your life for you you got to make it happen uh maybe you want to get out of debt get a better job get a promotion make it happen don't be afraid to take risk take chances live your life you know another thing you know I recently this this past week got together with Jack uh and he was talking about you know his home and how he has like 17 different projects He wants to do but then he's like but you know the truth is I can only do one at a time uh and I think that's good advice it's like you know maybe you have a lot you want to accomplish but but just focus on one thing at a time nobody can handle more than one thing at a time you got to be bold and take a hold of your life um oh yeah I'm in okay so one of the one of the uh bands I recently got into is 21 Pilots I never really got into them because all I ever heard was like their radio songs and I just didn't like them but then you know they came out with a new album just this past year and I decided just to listen to the whole thing and my job now I just listen to music all day and so I I decided to you know listen to the whole album I'm like oh my gosh this is like one of my favorite albums of all time just period um and and so then I started to listen to her previous albums like the other songs I never heard of like wow I I really like them uh but one of the songs in their latest album uh the name of the song is called oldie station I just want to read some of the lyrics it says fear of the past and relative pain Future's coming fast you've got nothing in the Tain in a season of purging things you used to love everything must go make an oath then make mistakes start a streak you're bound to break when darkness rolls on you push on through push on through then before you know you lose some people close forcing you to manage your pace you found your capacity for love and tragedy embracing how things always change you've had your turns with relative pain you're a little less concerned when there's nothing in the tank in a season of lessons learns and giving up you learn what you can and can't take add some you build some trust you start to feel your eyes adjust when darkness rolls on you push on through push on through and I just love this song you know it's like kind of like a Coming of Age song where you just are maturing in life and I think for me you know it was it was touching when I first heard it I like man it just felt relevant to my life you know and I feel like it is relevant to just the whole church you know you we have to embrace life life is always changing uh we can't be afraid of life you you cannot be afraid when we make mistakes you know I love even this this quote of like start a streak you're bound to break uh you know sometimes for me it's like I don't want to start something unless unless I know I'm GNA see it through uh but again that just leads to nothing and so you can't be afraid to fail you can't be afraid to make decisions if you fail it's okay get back up keep going um I want to end uh my lesson in Ecclesiastes uh Ecclesiastes also is one of my favorite books in the Bible um you know and it was written by the wisest person to ever Liv And so there's quite a bit of wisdom in there um and there's there's four times where Solomon uh uses the phrase uh nothing better and you know the idea is like there's nothing better than this or that uh and I think you know coming from the wisest person to ever live I think don't you want to know what what is nothing like what's the best thing to do in life so the first time he uses it in chapter 2 verse 24 I'm just going to read them if you want to write them down Ecclesiastes 2:24 he says a person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their toil chapter 3:12 I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and do good while they live chapter 3:22 so I saw that there was nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work because that is their love chapter 8 verse1 15 so I commend the enjoyment of life because there is nothing better for a person Under the Sun than to eat and drink and be glad then Joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of their life God has given them under the sun you know I truly believe that that this is God's heart that there is nothing better for you in your life than to take control of your own life to make decisions decide to make you know the most of what God has given you God has given you life and and and God wants you to make the most of it God wants you to be happy God wants you to enjoy your life you have to be grateful and enjoy your life with God you know gratitude is a decision Joy is a decision happiness is a decision you know uh some of the the happiest people in the world have nothing you know stuff isn't going to make you happy stuff makes you more miserable to be honest if if you don't if you don't appreciate it if you don't take care of it the way that God intends you know even in in times of uncertainty you have to put your hope in God put your hope not in this life but in the life to come be grateful when times are good be surrendered when times aren aren't going the way you want don't freak out don't try to control things you can't control uh you know here's the truth Comfort is reserved for heaven if your goal in this life is to be comfortable then then then you're probably forfeiting your opportunity to make it to heaven but aren't you excited for heaven understanding that having that hope is what's going to allow you to to be okay with the uncomfortable allow you to make hard decisions because we're not looking forward to anything on this life we're looking forward to eternal life with heaven where true Comfort true peace true Joy will be where there will be no more tears so family let us Embrace this life that God has given us take hold of your life whatever is not from God Drop It Like It's Hot be bold take hold of the life that has that God has given you and to God be the glory",

    "summary": "The sermon \"Take Hold Of Your Life\" urges listeners to make radical decisions by shedding sin and worldly attachments, encapsulated by the phrase 'Drop It Like It's Hot.' Speaker Kyle Swann emphasizes the Greek word 'afei' (to let go, forgive) as foundational for repentance and spiritual progress. He encourages boldness in decision-making, even when uncomfortable, and finding true joy and satisfaction in life by trusting God's specific plan. The message culminates in a call to embrace life with gratitude, actively pursuing God's will instead of seeking earthly comfort, to ultimately secure eternal life.",

        "verse": "1 Timothy 6:11-16",
        "insight": "This passage is central to the sermon's title, urging believers to 'flee' from worldly temptations, 'pursue' righteousness, 'fight the good fight of the faith,' and 'take hold of eternal life.' The speaker highlights these action verbs as a blueprint for ongoing repentance and commitment, emphasizing the need to let go of everything else to tightly grasp God's ultimate offering."

        "verse": "Matthew 3:15, Matthew 4:18-22, Matthew 6:14-15",
        "insight": "These verses collectively illustrate the Greek word 'afei,' meaning 'to let go' or 'forgive.' The speaker uses them to show practical applications of letting go: surrendering to God's plan even when it doesn't make sense (Jesus' baptism), abandoning one's former life to follow Jesus (disciples dropping nets), and releasing bitterness and unforgiveness towards others to receive God's forgiveness."

        "verse": "Revelation 3:15-19",
        "insight": "This message to the church in Laodicea exposes the danger of being 'lukewarm' and comfortable with sin, cautioning against self-sufficiency. The speaker interprets Jesus' counsel to 'buy' gold (faith), white clothes (purity), and eye salve (vision) as an invitation to invest deeply in God, acknowledging that true spiritual riches come at a cost and require moving out of complacency."

      {
        "verse": "Hebrews 4:14-16",
        "insight": "This passage encourages believers to approach God's 'throne of grace with confidence,' not based on their own righteousness, but on Jesus' high priesthood and understanding of human weakness. The speaker emphasizes that God desires us to come to Him with our mistakes, confident in His forgiveness and love, which is essential for receiving mercy and grace in times of need."

        "insight": "Solomon's recurring declaration of 'nothing better' highlights God's desire for humanity to find joy, satisfaction, and happiness in life. The speaker explains that this involves being grateful, enjoying one's work and daily provisions, and making the most of the life God has given, rather than being consumed by fear, control, or the pursuit of earthly comfort."

spend some good time but it's always great to visit the Tempa Mighty church and well Lind and I are in Mexico City right now but uh God willing in January we'll move to LA so we're going back to LA after 21 years as missionaries so we've been 21 years in Brazil Chile Argentina Venezuela and Mexico so we're going back uh we're we're grateful to be back and God is going to bless it amen so uh we're a local church for those who are visiting us but we do have a a world view so we're a local church but at the same time our focus is to evangelize the world in our generation amen therefore we have churches all over the world and we've divided the world in by in in in groups so that the world can be evangelized so for example I represent uh specifically Latin America so I mean we have churches in Mexico bota Colombia H Kito Ecuador uh Lima Peru Santiago Chile uh we have churches in uh kabamba Bolivia uh Sal Paulo Brazil Rio Janeiro Brazil uh so God is moving in Latin America but we also have churches all over the world so I love this map here I love it I love it we have churches all over Africa we have like 26 churches in Africa uh we have a whole bunch of churches in Europe uh churches in India in in Eurasia Russia former Soviet Union Asia Etc so so please be praying for the evangelization of the world in our generation amen [Applause] but right now we're going to study the word of God let's go to Ezekiel chap 37 the title of today's lesson is nothing is impossible nothing is impossible Ezekiel 37 is um it's a scripture that a lot of us older Christians know but it's good to read it again it's about the valy of the dry bones so we're going to read a little bit there all right Ezekiel 36 7 verse1 here Ezekiel gets a vision from God and it's a crazy Vision it says verse one the hand of the Lord was upon me and he brought me out by the spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a valley it was full of Bones he led me back and forth among them and I saw great many bones on the floor of the valley bones that were very very dry he asked me son of man can these bones live I said oh sovereing Lord you alone no that's a good answer yeah um this is a great passage because here we see a vision I mean Ezekiel is taken to a valley can you imagine just being in a valley and the valley is full of Bones human bones like there's no flesh in them and he's walking you know among the bones they're crackling they're breaking they're they're he's walking among those bones and he's going back and forth in it it's like a scene from a movie and God asks him a question can these bones live what is the obvious answer impossible how could bones live they're dead I mean they're bones impossible bones cannot live right bro yet when God asks him a question he says only you know Lord why because God can do anything God can do anything God is not limited by uh by any of our lack of faith God is not limited by our limitations by Humanity God can do anything he created the universe he can do anything there's no limitations for God for God nothing is impossible he can do anything let's keep reading here so when God asks you a question NE never question God come on uh because God can do anything that's right when humans ask you a question NE never limit God God can do and will do anything well I want to plant a church here I want to do this you know what never take away people's Faith always validate their faith because God can do anything and everything amen so let's keep reading here in verse um in verse 5 verse four he said then he said to me prophesy to these bones and say to them dry bones hear the word of the Lord this is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones I will make breath enter you and you and you will come to life I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin I will put breath in you and you will come to life then you will know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I was prophesying there was a noise a rattling sound and the bones bones came together bone to bone I looked and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them but there was no breath in them let's stop there amazing passage God gives a a simple solution you know how I can make these bones live preach to the bones you preach the word of God to the bones on he doesn't even preach he says prophesy to the bones just preach the word to these bones and they will come back to life what what do I preach God he says just preach that they will come back to life preach my word and it's going to happen so what does uh Ezekiel do well I'm going to obey the Lord here he goes I'm going to go ahead and preach to the bones can you imagine have you ever done that no one has ever done that right he's in a there's Bones on the floor and you start preaching to Them Bones come to life right now and you're walking among them they're crackling they like Bones come to life and the Bones start like like like levitating you know and and tendons AR I mean they start forming and they form actual bodies see that is the power of the word of God see God has no limitations and your limitation there's no limitations because when you preach the word of God there's no limitations that is the power you and I have because we have this we have the Bible this is the word of God right when you preach the word Anything Can Happen people will be saved Mountains will be moved churches will be planted Hearts will be healed because nothing is impossible for God what is it the problem is that we don't preach the word enough he doesn't even say preach he doesn't even say preach he says prophesy you know what prophesying means it means to tell something what's it means to tell what's going to happen in the future so that's exactly what he did Bones come to life they came to life they started flying coming to life all the tendons you know it's like uh it's like a scene from the movie The Mummies remember that old movie in the 80s the mummies 90s uh Tom Cruz right uh the the mummies come to life I mean did guys there's no there's nothing impossible when you prophesy when you preach the word that's how we need to be in our Bible talks we need to go to our Bible talks and say this is what's going to happen we we're going to save five people this month by faith and then maybe God does four but but you got four amen I mean but that's that's what we need to do we need to believe when you go into your Bible talk starting this New Year prophesy in your Bible talk tell us what's going to happen in your Bible talk God's going to grow this Bible talk and bible talks to our small group groups that we have in the church the campus ministry this is what's going to happen in the campus ministry we're going to grow we're going to baptize people people are going to get saved leaders are going to be raised up that that's how you're going to you and I need to to see our classrooms our classes God is going to do great things prophesy preach to them amen and let's keep reading here in in verse seven in verse n there was no breath in them so then he said to me prophesy to the breath prophesy son of man and say to it this is what the Sovereign Lord says come from the Four Winds oh breath and breathe into these Lane that they may live so I prophesied as as he commanded me and breath entered them they came to life and stood up on their feet a vast Army it's interesting he he prophesied and the miracle happened but not completely the miracle happened the bodies were formed every the the everything was good the muscles everything but there was no life in them so then he preached to the breath the breath enter them and now they became alive symbolically and they became a vast Army what is the issue here sometimes you you got to persevere in preaching because you got to persevere sometimes you want the miracle to happen but you don't persevere enough you don't persevere enough you got to keep preaching the word because sometimes you you do it one time two times three times and you think well people are not open no one can be saved right yeah but then God wants you to do it five more times and someone can be saved I remember when I was um in uh in La I was living in in Fullerton and I had a goal to share my faith that day I don't know like 20 people uh sometimes you know it's good to get goals sometimes sometimes we made goals even of a 100 people when we had no Bible studies and at that point I was a number 19 and I was like man no one's open here on campus today you know how you feel you know 19 people giving you like nose nose nose but I got to I got to do one more so I did one more that person said yes study the Bible and was baptized and became a Christian amen and he's still in the ministry to this day with his wife he's in the full-time Ministry in Canada so uh I mean it's it's amazing what God can do when you persevere amen you just got to persevere you got to keep preaching the word sometimes we get discouraged because we don't preach enough yeah we we we don't get the Bible in our hearts enough that's why your quiet times is one of the most important parts if not the most important part of your day what is a quiet time is when you read the Bible and you pray on I need to pray not to be spiritual I need to pray to be normal right I if I don't pray I the emotions control me a little bit I need to pray to be normal now if I want to be extra spiritual I need to pray a whole bunch more amen and the Bible we need to love the Bible the Bible it's it never gets old that's right I read a lot of books but there's nothing like the Bible I mean our sister has has been a disciple for 25 years amen I mean the Bible doesn't get old in 25 years we got Jack McGee here how many years have you been in the lord7 47 years I mean the Bible doesn't get old in 47 years in 50 years because the Bible is the word of God it is living and active when you read the Bible something incredible happens either you learn something new or if you're older you learn something that you forgotten amen or you you you you you you receive a different angle on on something you already knew that is the word of God that is why it's so powerful for us to be a movement of the Bible amen and righteousness and love and at the same time we need to evangelize the world so here we see that it takes time for the miracle to happen yeah let's keep reading on let's keep reading in verse 11 it says then he said to me God son of man these bones are the whole House of Israel the church they say our bones are dried up and our hope is gone and we're cut off therefore prophesy and say to them this what the Sovereign Lord says oh my people I'm going to open your Graves and bring you up from them I will bring you back to the land of Israel then you my people will know that I am the Lord when I open your Graves and bring you up from them I will put my spirit in you and you will live I will put my spirit in you and you will live I will settle you in your own land then you will know that I the Lord have spoken and I have done it declares the Lord see the whole Vision was an analogy for ezekiel's Faith the whole Vision was telling them you know these dry bones that came to life this this is the church this is the whole this is the whole house of Israel this and I want to give them hope I want to give you hope I will take you from your Graves and give you life again amen and then I will put my spirit in you and then you will do great things see that's what God wanted to do with Israel he wanted to give them hope through Ezekiel he wanted to give them the hope of the holy spirit that they will rise again and do great things Amen in our family of churches we've gone through quite a bit of stuff in the past few months but you know what God is Sovereign God allowed it and God allowed it so we can be better God allowed it so we can be closer to him God allowed it so we can be more righteous more loving and check this out and even more evangelistically Evangelistic God allowed it so that we can be closer to God and God wants to get you out of your grave spiritually climb out you know and and do great things for God once again God wants us to to not only get out of the graves he wants to give us the spirit and and the prophecy here is that you know this is the old Covenant and the New Covenant will be a covenant of the spirit in which uh you will receive the Holy Spirit indwelling In You amen so this is an amazing nothing is impossible for God especially when his spirit is in you and if you're a disciple you have the Holy Spirit what is the holy spirit it's God you know we believe in one God Amen but God manifests himself as the father as the son and as the holy spirit so what we we consider the Trinity right but we don't talk a lot about the Holy Spirit we we we we speak a lot about you know the Jesus we we talk a lot about God but how about the Holy Spirit biblically you can be full of the holy spirit being full of the holy spirit is so important because it's it's something that we need to strive to every single day it's like being full of food right after Thanksgiving you were full right some of us like myself gain a few pounds even you know but what's going to happen the next day you're going to get hungry day again in in the young people here the next hour you're going to get hungry again right you you want to eat again see spirituality is like is like your stomach it it's it's it's not a one time and done thing it's not like your resume spirituality for some of us we think is our resume we think well I've been a disciple whatever 15 20 years 30 years that's great but that's not what constitutes someone's spirituality spirituality is like going to the gym what happens if you don't go to the gym you lose your muscles right I even lose the muscles I didn't didn't know I had you know I mean I don't have many muscles I I need to go to the gym just to have strength amen uh but but that's what happens to us we need to understand that that spirituality is daily and being full of the holy spirit is something that happens to us daily even a couple of times during the day so I'm going to show you to finish off here five ways to be full of the Holy Spirit five ways to be full of the Holy Spirit Point number one let's go to acts 4 acts 4 verse 29 the disciples are getting um persecuted here acts 4:29 and look what they say now Lord consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness stretch out your hand and heal perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus after they prayed the place where they were meeting was shaken and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word word of God boldly see one way to be full of the Holy Spirit come on is to is to pray radically they pray to God in in the midst of of their persecution they pray to God and God did a miracle there was a a little earthquake there and then they preached the word of God boldly see one way to be full of the holy spirit is to pray radically it's not just to pray it's to pray radically you understand what I'm saying yeah a lot of times we do we pray but they're not really at least for me they're not really great prayers you could be praying driving you could be praying uh you know distracted you know uh but if we pray radically you're full of the Holy Spirit but it's like food you're full of the Holy Spirit only for a little bit then you need to be full with the Holy Spirit again the next day or even the same day and pray radically again amen that that's you're full of the holy spirit being full of the holy spirit is something temporary temporarily it happens only in a short time but then you need to be full of Holy Spirit again amen so Point number one pray radically Point number two Ephesians 5 let's go there Verse 18 you guys with me here Ephesians 5:18 it says this on do not get drunk on wine that's a good advice amen which leads to the buty instead be filled with the Holy Spirit how speak to one another with Psalms IMS spiritual and spiritual songs sing and make music in your hearts to the lord always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says do not get full of wine but but instead be filled with the Holy Spirit how by speaking to one another Psalm song and singing singing radically gets you full of the Holy Spirit see music is a spiritual entity God knows that and Satan knows that as well a lot of the music out there is full of bad words it's full of insinuation sexual inuendos I mean the music is both powerful is very powerful both positively and also negatively so what's the one way to be full of Holy Spirit singing radically at church when you sing don't you feel like when you sing radically you go man that's awesome you feel your heart getting full of God when you meditate on the words you go and you go wow I've sang that song A lot of times but I'm now actually thinking about the words you know and now I believe that now I mean sing radically even when you're by yourself and you're in the shower sing radically no no one hears you in your home sing radically I mean singing is of God and by the way you don't need to have a great voice amen some of us don't have a great voice because God for knew that you were too prideful to have a good voice you wouldn't become a you wouldn't stay faithful if you did so but the Bible says we can make a Joyful Noise to the Lord let's do that so the second way to be full of the holy spirit is to sing radically sing to God uh listen to music in the morning when you have your quiet times to some that helps them sing songs in the morning get full of the holy spirit amen number three let's look Luke 24 let's go there Luke 24 how to be full of the holy spirit in Luke 24 Jesus is talking to two disciples in a different form and they did not recognize them until the end afterwards they talk to each other and they say this in Luke 24:30 when he was at the table with them he took bread gave thanks broke it and began to give it to them then their eyes were open and they recognized him and he disappeared from their sight they asked each other were not a Hearts burning within us when he talked with us on the road and opened the scripture to us they got up and returned at once to Jerusalem Jesus appeared to these two disciples on the road to Emmaus and then he had he had dinner with them and he explained the scriptures to them and then he as he as as they were eating together they their eyes were open and they recognized that's Jesus and immediately what happens he disappears he uh he teleports somewhere you know that's Jesus he can do whatever he wants and then they say wow were not our hearts burning burning with passion when he explained the scriptures to us see one of the ways one the third way to be full of Holy Spirit is to love God's word radically you got to love it it it's a privilege to love the Bible it's a privilege to read it's a privileged to pray just love the Bible listen to the Bible online uh do Bible studies read it meditate on it I love the scriptures I love to read the Bible and I've read the Bible a long time many time many many many many times many different versions many times uh 28 times I've read the Bible from cover to cover and in different versions different languages and you know what it's always new it's always different it's always great so when you read the word of God when you love the word of God radically your hearts your heart gets full of the Holy Spirit but only tempor early then you need to do the same thing the next day amen so that's that's an incredible way and something about reading and praying radically is this when we go through hard times I find that most of us and I include myself there sometimes we read less and we pray less when we go through hard times we get overwhelmed with the problems with the difficulties with the challenges and what do we we do we become overwhelmed and we pray less and read the Bible less does that make sense any logical sense that happens because we're overwhelmed with our emotions we're overwhelmed with the problems and instead of going to God we think the best thing to do is to do nothing and just become depressed and get down and just eat a eat a a quart of ice cream as you watch Netflix you know and that's going to fix you spiritually you know or just scroll your phone for like hours you know there on Instagram you know I mean it it doesn't work guys it it is so simple yet we don't do it we go through a hard time we pray less we read the Bible less I mean at first when all this stuff happened in the church I I I felt like I was getting like like punched you know like right left I felt like I was like okay what's happening and and and to my shame the first at first I I was so shocked that I didn't get into the Bible as much I needed to or prayer then I repented amen I Repent but that's what happens when you go through a difficult time you you you you actually flee from God instead of getting closer to God and then we think well why is my life difficult well because of your problems because of you has nothing to do with the problems you make it difficult but not seeking God okay Point number four we had two quick ones amen acts 13 let's go there real quick verse 49 acts 13:49 let's go there Acts 13:49 says the word of the Lord spread through the whole region but the Jews incited God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city they stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their region so they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them and they went to Iconium the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit so here they're preaching the word they get persecuted the disciples right what do they do they they clean the dust of their of their feet symbolically and they go preach in another city Iconium and the Bible says at the end that they were filled with what with the Holy Spirit one of the ways so you get filled with the Holy Spirit is to love the mission radically see the mission God has given us to seek and save the the the Lost is so that other people can be saved yes but check this out it's also so that you can stay saved because when you study the Bible with people I don't know about you it happens to me you discipleship you go you know what I need to be a disciple too you know uh you do a seeking God study you go you know am I really seeking God that much you know so so so study the Bible with people helps you you the cross study right and you get broken and you're like man now I'm broken up on the cross I I needed to study for me so when you when you study the Bible with people when you love the mission radically you are filled with the Holy Spirit and the and the mission is in Matthew 28 is not only to make disciples and baptize them but the hardest part comes afterwards is to teach them to what obey discipleship is is harder much harder than studying the Bible with people uh changing your character becoming more like Jesus dealing with your sin being open discipleship this is the Great Commission the Great Commission has three components you make disciples you baptize them two three you teach them to obey the final component never ends amen the the final component is always there until the Lord takes you to heaven and that's really the most important component because the the other two are quick we we need baptizing happens quick uh studying the Bible people well a couple months one month two months maybe three months so people can take a year which that's a long time since took a year over there but amen but even a year is a little bit in comparison to 25 years so so the whole point is that we should have the privilege of loving the mission radically I know when I'm when I'm full of problems the last thing I want to do is to share my faith but that's when we need to share our faith the most that's when we need to have discipleship times the most that's when we need to just pray for people to be open and be saved the most last Point let's go to First Thessalonian chapter 5 five ways to be full of the Holy Spirit come on and it's temporary I've done the sermon before but I never put the fifth point until now amen this is a new Point here I me first Thessalonians 5 verse 16 look what it says Be Joyful always pray continually give thanks in all circumstances for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus do not put out the spirit's fire how do you put out the spirit's fire you're not you're not happy you don't pray continuously we talked about prayer already but especially this you don't give thanks in all circumstances what is the what is the fifth way to be full of the Holy Spirit to have a radical gratitude if you're if you have a radical gratitude you will never fall away from God on Who falls away from God the one that's not grateful the one that has problems in their life and and says this is unfair why me why is it so difficult and then you become bitter you blame people and you ultimately even blame God and then you leave God to because you want some relief in your life and lo and behold you have relief for like a day a month and then but then your sin catches up with you and it becomes much worse gratitude is what keeps All of Us Faithful we're grateful that Jesus died for us on the cross and resurrected on the third day why do we do what we do I mean we why are we here because we're grateful that Jesus died for me on the cross and on the third days he rose again and I can be saved because of that our motivation is gratitude and and when we get the motivations mixed is when we have problems well I'm in the church because I want to be a leader well it's not wrong to want to be a leader but F it's it's more important first want to be a disciple amen and if you're a good disciple then God might raise you up to be a good leader but but in that order well I'm here in the church to because there's you know I want to find a great Christian girlfriend you know or a great Christian boyfriend well that's good but if you're not spiritual it's not going to even work in the church it only works if you're both disciples well I'm here because I want help for my marriage well you will get help for your marriage but you know what the biggest help in your marriage is that you are a disciple and you're like Jesus that that's the biggest help it's not I want to CH change my husband please uh yeah your your husband needs to be like Jesus but you need to be like Jesus too and vice versa amen so radical gratitude will keep you Faithful but that'll only fill you up with the Holy Spirit for that moment maybe even that day then the next day you need to apply it again amen so in conclusion what have we seen today that nothing is impossible for God what it seems impossible it's easy for God to do as disciples we need to understand that Ezekiel had a vision because God gave him the vision because God wanted to give Ezekiel hope so he could give hope to the nation of Israel he wanted them to know that after 70 years of Exile he would bring them back uh to to Jerusalem and he would he would rebuild the Temple once again he wanted to give them hope today this morning I this unworthy servant want to give you hope not because of me but because of the scriptures God has a great plan for your life and God has a great plan for your church you're not here just to fill a seat and sit down you're not here just to play Christianity you're here to make an impact in this community and if you make an impact in this community you will make an impact in the world because missionaries will be sent out so I mean that's what we're all about I want to encourage you to be full of the Holy Spirit how well this there's many other ways but these five ways are good pray radically sing radically love God's word radically love the mission radically and have a radical gratitude if you do that you'll be full of the Holy Spirit and God will bless you and to God be all the glory amen",

    "transcript": "go afternoon good morning family it is so great to be with you this morning God is alive in the Tampa Bay International Cur church this morning it's great to uh have the communion the singing was awesome uh I guess today I am the virtual tea evangelist would be virtual T evangelist this morning and uh already it's been exciting to see the brothers and sisters and see all your smiling faces guys it's awesome you know today I really want to talk about something and that's gonna I believe is g to help us I really believe that we all need a Revival in our heart this morning and today's topic is make your life in Christ great again I already know what you guys are thinking and I'm not g to preach politics I want to tell you that I'm going to preach the word amen remember the greatness of when you first found Christ remember the words from your mouth Jesus is Lord is we going to have someone that said that already said Jesus is Lord this morning amen remember the first person you shared your life with remember the man and woman who baptized you remember the group group of disciples who were in your Bible studies remember getting open about your struggles in repentant and feeling free free today we need a Revival amen the Bible says as you open your Bibles to Psalm 126 vers 1 again Psalm 126 ver 1 through3 the Bible says when the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion we were like those who dreamed our mouths were filled with laughter our tongues with songs of Joy then it was said among the Nations the Lord has done great things for them the Lord has done great things for us and we are filled with joy remember the dreams the excitement you had at first and God and his kingdom the encouragement date now but before the word encouragement came about it was just simply date but we got a little weird and we felt like we needed to have the word encouragement in front of the date to make us feel a little bit good like you know uh perhaps you know if I say encouragement date we can kind of soften the date thing so it's not so Mushy Mushy see when I came about it was just a date wasn't encouragement date if you're going on a date any way it's already encouragement because you are deciples amen why do you need the word encouragement in front of the word date probably because you're unspiritual I remember the first time I came to the church in New York City we had churches all over the world they were black there were white there were Hispanic there were Asians I even built a Japanese Ministry back in the day converted my first Japanese and then after that there were eight seven more Japanese after that God was moving in a POS possible way awful way they used their Bibles there were no telephones at that time they were fired up just happy disciples back then it was a little little bit more arthentic than it is today with the Bibles amen young old even the Kingdom Kids classes were fired up fiery Kingdom Kids classes it was difficult in the fellowship to be in the fellowship and someone walk by you and you not say hello or didn't give a big hog to somebody and you didn't feel weird about it see where am I going with this as we began to study the Bible God's dream became my dreams we need to real Revive Our Hearts and rethink the way we do things I want you to understand the church is amazing it's growing but I believe at some time we've got to sometimes get back to some of the basics I got a little challenge for you before I continue on my challenge for you is simply that when you're in the fellowship go after someone and give them a big hug and tell you tell them you love them that you don't even know because the truth is there are a lot of people in the church that didn't really know each other and the fellowship I came from everybody knew everybody and a church at 80 something is easy to get to know everybody but when you're in the Church of 400 500 a th000 and perhaps 5,000 it's very difficult so so my encouragement to you is take advantage of that amen my career as a professional dancer took a back seat while my dreams to evangelize the world and love God with all my heart became first priority my joy was exuberant as is as it is today that's the goal today it is for all of us to have a Revival in our heart let's bow our heads and pray father God in heaven thank you so much for the opportunity the privilege to be in God's kingdom to have a fellowship that is exuberant God to really give ourselves wholeheartedly to you first of all and to other people thank you so much God for the leadership around the world thank you God for allowing us to be in the most amazing country in America and we're so grateful God to be in America God I pray that you remove me out of the equation fill us with your Holy Spirit and let your word be the standard of Our Lives we love you Lord we thank you be with those who are way be with the conferences that are going on I pray that you Empower them and they come back God more on fire than they've ever been so that we can encourage one another all the more we love you Lord we thank you thank you for Jesus and your son and we pray these things in his name amen Point number one to make your life great in Christ great again there must be loyalty again to make your life in Christ great again there must be loyalty it's going to take loyalty to God number one amen what is the definition of loyalty devotion dependent honest to one person faithfulness commitment or obligation if you open your Bibles to Mark chapter 1 verse 35 to 38 Mark chapter 1 verse 35 to 38 the Bible says very early in the morning while it was still dark Jesus got up left the house and went off to a solitary place where he prayed Simon his companions went to look for him and when they found him they exclaimed everyone is looking for you Jesus replied let us go somewhere else to the nearby villagers so I can preach there also this is why I've come so he traveled through the Galilee and preaching to that synagogues and driving out demons Jesus prays in a solitary Place says very early in the morning while it was still dark he got up and he spent time with the Lord have you ever been up before on a date or someone stood you up on a date you know years ago as a young performer I was about 17 18 years old in the late 80s I had a performance I got my break dance clothes on my papalock outfit on and I was waiting to be picked up by a limousine first time I would have ever been in a limousine first time I was very very excited could wa all right so I was ready to go about p.m and the limousine didn't show up PA the manager hey what's going on no answer no answer finally picked up the phone after the show was over the manager told me simply wasn't enough money to go around so they cut me out believe me I was ticked off and I won't tell you the words I used I was angry as a matter of fact when I think about it I'm upset right now it bothers the heck out of me I'm gonna tell you that right now I got to go deal with that I didn't think about that when I was studying the Bible and I needed to probably confess that sin before I got baptized but I didn't remember it so I'm good to go don't worry about it don't worry about it I'm good to go but I was really ticked off about that since then I haven't trusted anybody after that for a very very long time you think I was TI but I mean think about it that was cold blooded man left me no limousine ride wow now let me ask a question do you stand up God in the morning he's sitting there waiting for you to spend time with you and you stand him up like it's no big deal how do you think God feels when you stand him up sitting in heaven perhaps tears falling down his eyes hoping and waiting for his child to spend time with him brothers and sisters we've got to get back to the basics fear God he is all powerful he created the heavens and earth he gives life in breath he gives it and he takes it why would you want to spend time with the most powerful man in the world and I'm not talking about the president of the United States or the future president of the United States I'm talking about God all Mighty you got to honor God by spending time with him every morning studying his word stop making excuses it's up to us to stay pure-hearted in order to make Christ great again in your life there must be loyalty turn on your Bibles open to 1st Samuel chapter 18 verses 1-4 1st Samuel 18 verses 1-4 after David had finished talking with Saul Jonathan became one in spirit with David and he loved him as himself from that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family and Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing he gave it to David along with his tunic and even his sword his bow and his belt what incredible sight Jonathan King Saul's son loved David as himself what brother or sister do you love as yourself let's pause for about five seconds think about that if you can't come up with one person you may be in danger you may be in danger we always encourage people to have five best friends at least when I was counting the cost that's what they said Anthony I want to encourage you to have five at least five best friends now I want you to say that's difficult to do because in order to have five best friends it takes work on your have it's not easy why do we want five because if you're struggling and you'll have five people to kind of help you along five is better than one amen you know back in 2008 in Orlando I made a bit stop this morning uh and got me a a drink in 2008 I desperately needed an intern you know Elizabeth and I plan it was just the two of us of course Lisa robart and her dear kids Noah was like I don't know eight years old at that time she and her family greeted us at the you know as we approached Orlando at our place and uh my friend Luke Speckman you guys heard him earlier today they were in charge of the GNN he was leading Arizona church at that time and he told me hey I have an incredible guy in the congregation his name is Chris Jones Chris talked to Chris instantly flew to Orlando moved in with us and became our intern for the church in a time that I needed a best friend and a right-hand man Chris became that for me he was a servant he shared his faith all day believe it or not all day then went home came home as he lived in us and served our kids to this day Chris is a big brother to my children and one of my best friends there was a need in another church and Chris had to be moved on to California his grandpa had died and and he became weak spiritually and he came so weak that he gave in a dating a non-Christian then I got a call saying Chris had fallen away instantly I immediately called him and convinced him boy what are you doing you need to get your foot back to Orlando and he listened he listened he got back here he was restored and you bet I took him to the next church planting to Houston with us and planted that church I was not about to leave my best friend and you know the blessings come out when you're obedient and you just listen Chris found him a girlfriend in Houston her name is vinica then she got baby she became a disciple and now is happily married got married here in Tampa and I was happy to marry them off but that's what happens when you give your heart you surrender you trust the spirit of God you trust the people that are in your life and you love them deeply from the heart you know like Woody would say from Toy's Story You've Got A Friend in Me Chris is my friend bro you got a friend in me so congregation if you're struggling who's goingon to come get you and talk some sense to you if Elizabeth and I struggled I know jeie McGee will come after Elizabeth like a bulldog I know that Jack will come after me I know that Noah will come after after me I know that Chris will come after me I know that Lisa robar will come after me like a bulldog I know that Jared will come after me I know that Steve and Melanie Coyle will come after me in the church Louis Louisville there we go I know that smooth in San Francisco will come after me I know that Jay and as in Dallas will come after me and last but not least Mary de will come after me you see after this lesson perhaps some of you will come after me or come after your brothers and sisters or come after someone in the fellowship amen we need to have a fierce loyalty towards each other love each other deeply we are God's family and we must must turn others toward God Amen so in order to have a great life in Christ again great to make it great again you must be loyal Point number two and last point to make your life in Christ great again we must love people 1 Corinthians 199 you don't need to turn there but the Bible says a very very incredible scripture Paul says though I am free and belong to no one I have made myself a slave to everyone to win as many as possible first Peter 1:22 tells us simply you must love people deeply amen from the hearts in John you can turn there John chapter 4 verse 7 John 4: 7 another example of great love 7 through 10 I know you guys got your phone so you're probably there pretty quickly eventually we'll get back to opening those Bibles it's the Bible says when a Samaritan woman came and draw water Jesus said to her will you give me a drink his disciples had gone into town to buy food the Samaritan woman said to him you are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman how can you make ask me for a drink for Jews did not associate with Samaritans Jesus answered her if you knew the gift of God and who it is that asked you for a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water water that living water is the refreshment that comes from accepting the teachings of Christ it is the metaphor that symbolizes the spiritual substance that Jesus offers us today amen Jesus was masterful in meeting the emotional needs of women gently calling them out in their sin you know he went up to this woman and later on in verse 30 9 you can skip down to verse 39 in the same chapter it says many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because the woman's of the woman's testimony he told me everything I ever did that's pretty cranking so when the Samaritans came to him they urged them to stay with him and he stayed for two days and because of his words many more for became Believers amen verse 42 they said to the woman we no longer believe just what you because of what you said but now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world what was amazing by this what was amazing by this is Jews did not associate with the S Samaritans they were half breeds half Jew Jews half Assyrian Jewish men did not speak with women Jesus resented the Samar Jews resented the Samaritans Jesus broke the boundaries of race and gender through spiritual love he stooped low to converse with the woman who was a Samaritan completely breaking the boundaries through spiritual love he went to the Samaritan people and he stayed for two days he ate from their plates and slept in their house he did what no other Jew would do his actions convinced him that he was the savior of the world the question is do your act actions convince people to come to church to hear the word of God you think about this was amazing his actions convinced the Jews your actions in Christ will convince your neighbors the Walmart cashiers the target car work car workers the your your medical physician at the doctor's office you heard earlier in the GNN uh doctors getting converted you need to convert these people they need to hear the word of God in see Jesus it's such a heated world the only things would change if we stoop low to make others gra convincing him through your actions that Jesus is our savior and the only true answer towards salvation are the people you're reaching out from all backgrounds all Races do you spend quality time with people who are completely different from you if the answer is no consider making that change exclamation point example one of my best friends is Tom shs non-Christian white country boy from hour he hates Sports and loves Electronics I hate electronics and love sports but I love Tom he's awesome he's incredible guy he's gonna make it sooner or later he's going to make it amen I would die for him although we are very different example when Elizabeth and I got married let's say the family wasn't exactly excited about it if you know what I mean I'm a black guy from the hood and Elizabeth is from an allwhite neighborhood her mom wanted Elizabeth to marry a doctor like her dad was at that point I knew I had my work cut out a lot of work cut out so I stood low stoop low to win her over I served her I I I shared my faith with her I listened to her story and over the years we became very close when she was dying of cancer I would call her and share scriptures with her encourage her then she became a disciple after 23 years Elizabeth loved her encouraged her built her up studied the Bible and baptized her amen five weeks later she died but it took me removing myself out of the equation and looking at the need making myself nothing to meet the need need of my mother-in-law amen bro she developed friends after that with black people at her job before she died she shared her faith and began to love all people I challenge every person in the church to make a friend with somebody who's completely different from you amen A different race a nationality share your faith with them give your life to them open the Bible with them have them in your home in New Orleans I reached out to Mr Louisiana this was before some of you guys were born and I baptized him white goodlooking white guy had him over for dinner or his parents actually had me over for dinner and interestingly at somewhere in that equation she said you know I want you to know Anthony I've never had a black person in my house it's pretty pretty radical pretty R you Miss Louisiana white family and they absolutely love me and I love them we became the best of friends see there is no fear in perfect love perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment the one who fears is not made perfect in love perfect love drives fear you gotta love people deeply amen last drip sh Matthew 28 you guys know where I'm going because you're Bible experts everybody's a Bible expert in this church amen you just got to use it preach it and convince the people the Bible says in verse 18 then Jesus came to them and said all authority in Heaven and Earth has been given to me therefore Go Make Disciples of all Nations baptize them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you and surely I'll always be with you to the very end of the age Jesus set an example and commanded us to imitate him says Go Make Disciples of all Nations not just black people not just white people not just Asian people not just Indian people all nations we must love all nations and not be prejudiced because the truth is all of us have some Prejudice in us and if you say you don't then you're probably telling a big fat lie then we will be different different from the entire hostile world people will be in awe of God because of your loyalty to him they will be in awe of God because of your love for people and your stupid down low to make others greater than you we must make our lives in Christ great again we must show the world that we are different and that we will see great victories in God kingdom to make your life great in Christ again you must be loyal to make your life great again we must love people to God be the glory bro come on come you guys are amazing
